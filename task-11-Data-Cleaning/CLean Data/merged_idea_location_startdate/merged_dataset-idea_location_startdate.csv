Navdy also came up with its own ios app that linked up with the main HUD device and provided it with the relevant navigational output to display to the driver.

Navdy’s pitch was quite straightforward. Whereas head-up displays are increasingly common in some cars (generally performance or luxury models), they’re still a relative rarity on mainstream vehicles, and there’s usually no retrofitting possible from the automakers themselves. Their solution, therefore, was a device that mounted on the dashboard that included a small, transparent display panel within the driver’s line of sight that would project navigational information right in front of the driver.",United States,2013,5.0,50-100,Shut Down,4.0

Vine,"Vine used to be a video hosting social media website which allowed users to create and share 6-second videos. A bit like TikTok (more on that below).

To put the concept in context, you could say that Vine tried to do to YouTube vlogs the same thing that Twitter did to traditional blogs. Twitter advertises itself as a microblogging social media platform because of its character length restrictions and social features (follows, retweets, etc.). Similarly, Vine was a microvlogging platform because of its video length restriction combined with similar social features.

Consequently, it makes a lot of sense that Vine was acquired by Twitter for $30 million before the app even launched. It presented Twitter with a convenient opportunity to compete with the (considerably bigger) social media giants like Facebook and Google on Video content.

Furthermore, ShipItWise signed contracts with large European freight forwarders and engaged smaller, local businesses to handle the shipping. The idea was that these smaller businesses could outsource their logistics departments to ShipItWise.",Estonia,2016,3.0,10-Jan,Acquired,5.0
