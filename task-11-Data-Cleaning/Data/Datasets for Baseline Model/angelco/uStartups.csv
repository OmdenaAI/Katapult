Changes to the JOBS Act in 2016 will open up 97% of the U.S. Market by allowing ordinary American’s (aka: non-accredited investors) to invest in private companies for the first time in over 83 years. The RAISE Act, which will be signed into law in the next 60 days allows shareholders (employees and investors) to liquidate shares in private companies in as little as 90 days; instead of the previous 12-month holding time.

"Keen IO","http://keen.io","Keen IO is an API platform that lets developers collect and study custom events at a massive scale.\n\nAn ""event"" is a pretty broad abstraction, so let's unpack that a bit:  Every time someone loads a webpage, clicks a link, draws a breath, takes a step, pauses a song, or starts a car, there's an event.  Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable.\n\nBut studying these sorts of custom events at massive scale is difficult, and before Keen IO, required a deeply specialized data engineering team.  We imagined a world in which any generalist software developer can wield event data powerfully well, and without such a specialized background.\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that we're a platform, not a product.  While a product company plots a course and steers into product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us.\n\nThis approach has given our business a diverse & robust base of earning power that is growing at an increasingly rapid rate.","Custom Analytics by API","San Francisco","Cloud Computing","Analytics","Developer APIs"

Employees hate doing it and executives hate spending on it. Yet training is more important than ever: University graduates are increasingly unprepared for the needs of the market. Millennials rank the opportunity to learn as their #1 criterion when choosing an employer. And experienced workers switching careers is the new norm.\n\nLearndot fixes training by making learning – not compliance – the goal of the system.
