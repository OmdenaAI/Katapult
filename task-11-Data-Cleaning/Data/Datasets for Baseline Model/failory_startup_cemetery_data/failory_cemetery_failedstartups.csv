RoomsTonite,Last-minute hotel booking provider,Travel,India,2014,2017,Bankruptcy,Lack of Funds,1,Suresh John,100-250,1,$1.5M,4,"RoomsTonite was a last-minute hotel booking app for people that decided to travel in or to India. It focused on listing hotels that had vacant rooms and could be filled on short notice. The app was free to download and could be found on the Apple and Google Store. The app specifically let people search and book rooms at a discounted price from about 4,000 hotels across 325 locations. The booked room was supposed to be filled on the same day or within 72 hours.",The company had announced to have raised $1.5 million in funding but the payment probably was late to arrive or didn’t go as planned and the company struggled to continue its operations. Both versions of the app were taken down.
Rafter,Textbook and course material provider for schools,Education,United States,2006,2016,Acquired,Competition,1,Sara Leoni,50-100,7,$86M,7,"Rafter was a textbook and course material provider for schools and colleges. The company, previously known as BookRenter, initially focused only on providing textbooks to educational institutions but decided to completely change strategy to gain an upper hand on its competitors. The company rebranded as Rafter and started providing cloud-based course material.

Rafter worked with small to medium colleges in particular, which found the bulk deals they were able to get hold of with Rafter advantageous. In this way, colleges were able to lower the prices of campus store books thus encouraging students to buy course material from the university instead of off-campus sites. Rafter also allowed instructors to find, sample and manage course material and provided digital books, audio, and video media as well as codes to access various online courses platforms.","Rafter had much competition from the start and it had to deal with both logistical, financial and market challenges from the onset. For starters, it was hard to convince large institutions to buy from the company as a single-source network of providing texts and notes. Also, not all students were pleased with Rafter’s model as they thought they could get text books for more affordable prices on their own and they didn’t appreciate the fact that the company required them to return the books at the end of the term.

However, the most crucial challenge for the company was the evolution of technology and its widespread adoption and inclusion into universities. Colleges could now directly deal online with the publisher, so the need to have a middle agent such as Rafter became minimal. Rafter announced its shut down in 2016. The digital assets of Rafter, including its Rafter360 solutions, were successively bought by eCampus in 2017."
Sharingear,Marketplace for musicians to rent their instruments,Music,Denmark,2014,2015,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Mircea Gabriel Eftemie,10-Jan,1,€15K,2,"Sharinger was a peer to peer musical gear sharing platform for independent musicians and touring bands. The startup’s founder, who had a decade of experience in the touring business, experienced first hand how the logistics of touring can be challenging, especially for small musicians. Sharingear's hoped to make touring more affordable and accessible. Users could create a profile and post the musical instruments or gears they had for free so that others could buy it or rent it.","One of the fundamental reasons the company’s CEO admitted for the failure of his company was that he focused on a market that was too small, and since they only charged a small commission per transaction, the business model set was not sustainable and would not cover for operations costs.

Second, there was a lack of a good product-market fit. Musicians might have told the founder that Sharingear was a great and functional product but cash-strapped musicians might resort to opting for the most economical arrangement, even if it’s not the most convenient.

Furthermore, there is to factor in that musical instruments and gear are very delicate and although the company insured every rented instrument, some people might feel reluctant to rent their own instrument or take someone else’s for fear of somehow damaging it.

There’s also the fact that musicians usually develop a preference for their own playing gear and performing with a rented one might have required some getting used to.

Sharingear, running out of budget and with fleeting employees, was not able to adapt and pivot soon enough and closed in late 2015.

Skully,Augmented reality motorcycle helmets,Transportation,United States,2013,2016,Shut Down,Mismanagement of Funds,1,"Marcus Weller, Mitch Weller",Oct-50,4,$15M,13,"Skully is a helmet trademark which targets motorcycle riders. News of the helmet generated considerable buzz as the company promised that their helmet would be the first Augmented Reality (AR) product of its industry offering unique technological features. The helmet comes with a rear facing camera and a heads-up display that can also be used to check contacts names and music streaming. The Skully helmet was to supposedly be the safest in the world since it offered a ""360° experience"" with its 180° blindspot camera. Riders could also avail of the hands-free voice calling and texting feature during their commutes.","According to Skully spokespeople they had to close shops due to limited fundings. They were reportedly not able to sum an additional round of funding to complete the production of the $2,000 pre-ordered helmets that about 3,000 people were looking forward to receiving. They filed for bankruptcy in 2016 but their product and assets were acquired in 2017 by what has been branded SKULLY Technologies, a new company that says to have no affiliation to the previous company (nor any obligations it might have to its clients) despite the fact that the two acquirers are the cousins of the previous Skully CEOs."
Wantful,Online gift-giving service,e-Commerce,United States,2011,2013,Shut Down,Competition,1,John Poisson,"10,000",1,$5.5M,8,"Wantful was an e-Commerce platform founded in 2011 with a base in San Francisco and New York City. The company targeted individuals looking to buy gifts for friends, family or acquaintances. Its objective was to help users by offering them personalized gift recommendations based on a set of input entered. The user needed to provide the site with information such as the gender, tastes and preferences of the person they were willing to donate the gift to and the platform would search through its inventory to bring a series of suggested items to the users. Wantful later expanded to allow users to find items for themselves as well and it even launched a series of popular products to complement their business.","After experiencing a brief phase of exponential growth, Wantful shut down in September 2013 due to stiff competition from other companies offering e-commerce services. While at the beginning they offered a fairly new type of platform by focusing on the customization and suggestion of gift ideas, when they tried to shift to a normal e-shop business in which users bought items for themselves they had to compete with established platforms such as Wanelo, Wish, Fancy, Svpply’s Want, Polyvore, and more.

In the later stages of the e-commerce business, it became evident that Wantful was not getting the kind of growth curves that venture capitals expected and desired and as a result failed to secure additional investment. This highly discouraged business with Nordstrom, a potential investor and strategic partner that Wantful heavily depended on for their long-term investment. The company closed in 2013."
99dresses,Virtual closet to trade fashion items,e-Commerce,Australia,2010,2014,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Nikki Durkin,10-Jan,2,$105.7K,4,"99dresses was a fashion application marketed as a virtual model closet which offered basic inter-trade of second-hand designer dresses between users. The brain-child of this application noticed the high turnover in ladies' closets, whereby they purchase a designer fashion dress, wear it a couple of times, get bored and end up leaving the dress hanging in the closet unused for the months and years to come. The founder of the startup figured that it could be profitable and extremely fascinating to connect two or more ladies with the similar issues, tastes, and needs and have them trade clothes; and so, 99 dresses was born.","99dresses was established by the 18-year-old Nikki who had no clue about the tech business. It successfully operated for one year after which it started encountering great money and technical related difficulties which prompted the shutting down of the app in 2014.

The key issue was that the organization did not raise enough income to maintain its tasks as the organization's plan of action depended on the exchange cost. Steadily, their exchanges diminished in cost and 99dresses' income endured a shot. Their plan to scale up to include handbags and different adornments, failed to gain traction and the number of exchanges in the platform dropped.

Difficulties in implementing innovation and absence of management experience likewise added to conveying deals to a stop and caused a drying up in funding sources. The startup also experienced Visa issues that obstructed smooth activities between the United States and Australia. With these series of events, the company’s group of prime supporters gradually gave up on the platform and the startup had to close down."
Argyle Social,Provided social media management tools,Marketing,United States,2010,2014,Shut Down,Competition,1,Adam Covati,Oct-50,2,$1.6M,2,"The Argyle Social was a Social media marketing tool. The company provided an easy to use, highly interactive platform for marketers to specifically improve their customers’ social media platform engagement and lead generation. Argyle was considered as having one of the best price-points in the market at some point. Widely praised for their intuitive dashboard and highly effective scheduling capabilities, Argyle had been for a period one of the most sought-after programs for many internet marketers.","Adam Covati, the former CEO and founder of Argyle Social, tried to stand out from their competitors by allowing their software to be integrated into various social media marketing automation software including Pardot and Marketo. This additional design Argyle Social had was really useful for marketers, but still, the bulk and massive marketing efforts of their competitors, unfortunately, drowned out that value.

The funds were never enough to keep the software in the market, not to mention that the company still had to pay its employees.

Leading social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter change their APIs every time. For Argyle Social to work, Covati and his team needed to keep up with those changes as well, and that was a huge struggle for them. They had talent and skill but lacked the appropriate number of employees needed to accomplish such task. The company’s lack of employees came about from their first issue, which is not having enough funds. Without the appropriate funds, it was impossible for Argyle to keep their services in the market. Adam Covati said that he tried numerous times to find a willing business partner to keep the company alive, but no company or individual ever found Argyle to be “profit wise”."
Karhoo,Cab aggregator and price comparison tool,Transportation,United Kingdom,2014,2016,Acquired,Poor Product,1,Daniel Ishag,50-100,2,$39M,3,"Karhoo was a cab aggregator and price comparison tool. Through its app, users could get a glance of all the licensed taxis, regulated and private cars for hire that were in the area. The user would be shown the pricing and location of the various cars on a map and they could then book rides with their cab of choice. Unlike other companies which have their own fleet of car, Karhoo relied on already available cabs and it took a 10% commision from the rides booked through its app.","Karhoo was out of business after barely 6 months of operation despite having an objectively innovative and useful product.

Based on the various online reports and articles, it seems that the two main reasons for Karhoo’s failure were poor management and faulty execution of a good concept.

Since the company was looking for more investors it went on a full-blown marketing campaign to entice people to use the service and show potential investors that the app was indeed widely used. As a promotional too, they offered free rides to passengers. The problem was that app codes never seemed to expire and people would use £100 worth in free rides. There was also a bug that sometimes prevented the app from accepting credit cards payments.

The CEO of Karhoo was also reported as listing large personal bills showing his lavish lifestyle including expensive shopping sprees, hair salons, $6,000 treatment for his pet dog, 10-year lease of 3 New York apartment, luxurious parties, costly flights and stays in top hotels to mention some. On the other end, employees were asked to skip paychecks until Karhoo's finances got better. When the unexpected news that the company would shut down was announced, employees were also told the company didn't have enough money to pay them and that they wouldn't receive the payment for the previous month as well since the company was closing with $10,000 in its account.

Karhoo has been acquired by RCI Bank and Services in January 2017 and has been rebranded as Flit Technologies."

At first, PoliMobile began as a software-as-a-benefit (SaaS) platform and later updated into a Mobile application that could be utilized over an assortment of campaigns. PoliMobile's primary goal was to engage people by making use of text messages on their mobile. The application could recognize particular groups utilizing registration information and send customized messages that were used for building and creating awareness.","PoliMobile had a few major issues.

First of all, no one wanted to pay for such a service, and they doubted it could be more effective than the traditional campaigning methods that were already being used. Numerous campaigns agreed to accept trials but never ended up becoming paying customers and the founder realized that during the preliminary take-off stages he never actually asked politicians and people in charge of campaigns if and how much they would actually pay for such a product.

The founder also believed that PoliMobile might have been launched at the wrong time, because, although the technology was functioning well, its target market might have not been yet ready to use it."
Delicious,"Bookmarking website to save, organize and discover links",Productivity,United States,2003,2017,Still Active,Acquisition Flu,1,Joshua Schachter,50-100,1,No Data,10,"Delicious was a social bookmarking site that was founded in the year 2003 by Joshua Schachter and Peter Gadjokov. It was created to be different from other bookmarking platforms by enabling its users to store and share bookmarks. Delicious also let users access their saved bookmarks anywhere, anytime. It was free and allowed visitors to group links, save homepages, and work collaboratively with other users too. Delicious went on to become one of the most popular social bookmarking sites on the internet.","There are a few reasons that slowly but inevitably caused the downfall of this once-promising startup.

Delicious was a pretty good site before it was sold to Yahoo! in 2007. Two years later, even the founder regretted accepting the offer. Yahoo was already a giant back then and Delicious and its team were a very small part of it which became largely neglected. Launching the new version of the site after the acquisition was supposed to take 6 months, but, instead, it dragged on and didn’t see the light until two years later. The site was also buggy and there were frequent technical problems.

By that time other tools similar to Delicious were already dominating the sector, Pinterest, Trello, Evernote, Pinboard, Pocket, were only some of them. Besides the competitive factor, there is also to say that when Delicious was launched, it was very useful in searching for information through bookmarks a user or other registered people had already saved since Google was not as powerful as it currently is. When search engines started crawling and indexing billions of websites it became easier for people to find relevant content so the need for what Delicious offered decreased over the years.

The site went from one ownership to another until it was finally bought by its then competitor, Pinboard, for a bargain."
QBotix,Solar panels attached and regulated by robots,Software & Hardware,United States,2010,2015,Shut Down,Competition,1,Wasiq Bokhari,Oct-50,3,$23.5M,7,"QBotix seemed like a very promising cleantech startup, so much so that it was able to raise a collective $23.5M in funding. QBotix offered solar panels that were attached and regulated by robots which could track solar light and rotate the panels automatically. The aim was that of reducing systems cost and maximize efficiency and productivity.","QBotix had a useful and innovative product. The two-axis tracker system they came up with was the first of its kind and it was supposed to be an upgrade from the one-axis solar trackers present in the market. What happened, though, was that the technology and the efficiency of their competitors in the single-axis sector improved so rapidly that it made the traditional product more cost-effective and optimized than what QBotix came up with.

Adding to that, investors realized that the market acceptance and adoption of QBotix weren't as fast as they were expecting it to be so funding started to dwindle. QBotix then tried to license the product and provide its software for other companies to use, but the move wasn't successful and they had to lay off their staff and announce the shutdown of their operations."
Reach.ly,Analytics tool for e-Commerce sites,Analytics,Latvia,2011,2015,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Ernests Štāls,10-Jan,3,€200K,2,"Reach.ly was an analytics tool for e-commerce sites providing actionable customer behavior patterns. It engaged in a real-time analytics infrastructure, which allowed e-commerce sites to engage with their customers through customized messages. Their websites tailored to uncover customer behavior and enable real-time customization. It helped the site owners understand sales and conversion rate comparison between various channels. The customers’ behavior patterns were uncovered by deploying machine for recognizing patterns and learning.","Reach.ly had purposed two objectives before its closure in 2015. Its iterations were behavioral analytics for e-commerce and Twitter mining solutions for hotel industries. The company, by the CEO own admission, failed because it mixed up ideas and models of the previous business into the new venture. Reach.ly did not start afresh but kept all the previous undertakings in operation. It lacked room for other investors and only survived on the CEO shares. Secondly, technology failed them terribly. It started out big but it did not scale up, the regret was that it could have started with a simple stack to test the idea. The free hosting received from Soft layer led the company to spend too much on technology without a single customer or a working prototype.

Lack of proper market feedback and pilot client was also a setback. It did not create appropriate tracking solution and their data set had loopholes. Without any consultation, they switched to another platform called Shopify with standardized API and app marketplace. It turned out that the Shopify players were smaller than expected and thus failed to serve Reach.ly goals. Lastly, the initial team recruited was heavily technology-centric and lacked teamwork, passion and business vision. A big part of the team eventually left the firm or was let go; precious time and resources were spent to find a new committed and talented team. Had this been done from the beginning the company might have has a better chance of succeeding."
BitPass,Online payment system for digital content,Finances,United States,2002,2007,Shut Down,Competition,1,Kurt Huang,50-100,2,$13.3M,6,"Bitpass was a company that gave people a platform to make micropayments online. These payments were ranging from one cent to a dollar. BitPass developed an online payment system for digital content and services like the downloadable music and PDFs. Mperia, an online music store founded in 2003, was one of its greatest projects for unsigned artists. BitPass customers included giants such as Disney and Microsoft.","The main reason for closure as stated in their email was competition. The newly rolled Google Checkout payment system, which was offered for free, made BitPass business superfluous. Bitpass CEO originally hoped to get their micro payment features integrated into Google checkout but that never happened. After raising about $12 million and acquiring one of its competitors Bitpass journey came to an end in 2007.

Flowtab,Mobile app to order drinks on nightclubs,Food & Beverage,United States,2011,2013,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,1,Mike Townsend,50-100,0,-,0,Flowtab was a mobile app that wanted to use technology to solve the problem of long queues in bars and hospitality venues. Flowtab created an app that would show users a list of drinks they could order from their mobiles without having to wait for the bartender to take their order. The app was connected to the bar's iPad which would then sync the orders to the POS terminal of the bar and payments would be are sent to the bar's bank account.,"Flowtab tried various business model but could never found one that was both feasible and profitable. On paper, any bar would have wanted to use such an application. In reality, it proved quite hard for the company to get deals. This type of service requires a large number of users to be profitable since they only charged the customer $1 after they successfully placed an order. However, users don't usually stick to the same bars but would often choose a different one from week to week, and most users only used the app once or twice per month. Things could have still worked out, but when, in a promotional event they invited about hundred people to various clubs, their technology failed them and the founders resorted to serving drinks themselves to angry customers. This caused many people to leave one-star ratings for the app further thinning the chances of the app success.

Since their funding was limited they were also understaffed and a very small team had to take care of everything. After a couple more pivots and some members of the team leaving to pursue other goals, Flowtab finally decided to shut doors."
Moped,Free messaging application,Social Media,Germany,1998,2014,Acquired,No Market Need,1,Schuyler Deerman,Oct-50,1,$1M,4,"Moped was a social app available for every device. Registered users could send and receive messages from their network connections. Beside the messaging service for both private and business purposes, Moped also offered a variety of other services to its users online. Some of its features included the possibility to upload the content and share it online with other users through Dropbox, or even to explore what nearby places offer good services, food, party, etc, by partnering with the Foursquare App. Moped also allowed all registered users to perform complex tasks by using multiple apps at the same time, with the help of the integrated IFTTT (if this, then that) app.","The main reason why Moped didn’t take off was that it had not enough entertaining and fast-growing content of the kind that could attract a broad mass of users to join. They tried refreshing the old content by integrating a new feature which nonetheless was not recognized as something groundbreaking in the era where other social apps with similar features already enjoyed growing popularity.

Moped was unable to see that without significant revenues and with their old and outdated content, they could not stand a chance in competing with other similar social apps. Despite their efforts and the new ideas they implemented, they attracted a disappointingly small group of users but lost a greater amount of its initial user base. The popularity and the number of users saw a steady decrease. That defeat led to the loss of all their revenue and they couldn’t find someone to invest in additional rounds. Moped officially closed and was bought by Berlin-based company 6Wunderkinder which was in turn acquired by Microsoft in 2015."
Leap Transit,Provider of private transit and offers bus services,Transportation,United States,2013,2015,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,1,Kyle Kirchhoff,50-100,1,$2.5M,4,"Leap transit was a private transport service based in San Francisco, they offered bus services with eye-catching and comfortable interiors. Leap was supposed to fill a gap in the transport system by serving people that didn't want to pay for an Uber ride every day and yet preferred a quieter environment to the public transport offered in the city. The buses had Wi-Fi, leather seats, AC sockets. They also had a mini bar offering snacks and beverages.","The primary reason for Leap quick exit from the private transport scene was their failure to comply with the San Francisco regulations. Besides not having requested permission from the city administration, they committed a second infringement when they removed the front door ramp which by law should be present in bus to make the vehicle accessible to people with disabilities.

Furthermore, although their service might have been useful, it was seen with a mix of dislike and outrage. The original inhabitant of the city generally seemed to dislike bus services that seemed to be aimed at the new “tech population” that came into the city and they even went so far as to protest their very presence. Another complaint was also that the buses also congested the SF streets.

Leap had not enough passengers to make a decent profit, even if they charged them $6 per ride. When the California Public Utilities Commission issued a cease and desist notice to the company they halted their operations.

Berg,Commercialized cloud services for hardware innovators,Design,United Kingdom,2005,2014,Shut Down,No Market Need,1,Matt Webb,Oct-50,1,$1.3M,2,"Berg was a cloud platform on which Little Printer, an Internet-of-Things device, worked. Berg allowed users to print out interesting news from the web, social media, etc. across devices. Little Printer looked like a receipt printer but could be used as a social letterbox, targeting mainly families. It produced little retro style printed papers that could be used for various purposes. The competitors of Berg’s Little Printer were Turtle Mail, Ink and Memo Bird.","Berg had an interesting journey from the boardroom to folding the business; they tried to change their business model a couple of times halfway through it but to no avail.

Besides the fact that the product that they created served a very limited market need (if ever a need was there), paper consumption and the creation of waste was an element that turned many people that cared about the environment away.

Berg’s little Internet of Things device had a small group of supporters, which, while loyal, could not convert into a sustainable way to maintain and manage the business. People also argued that the advertisement put out by Berg failed to show how the little printer working on the Berg platform could improve users' life. It was, objectively speaking, more a luxury item/toy rather than a device that anyone would need.

While print newspapers are struggling to continue their existence, it was hard for Berg to convince people that they needed the Little Printer in their homes. Moreover, publishing content through the Little Printer would need to weigh in the design factor of the publisher’s needs. Only certain type of contents could fit on the receipt-size paper the device could print. Also, because of its size, the commercial sector would not be that interested in it.

However, people can be irrational and buy products on a whim only because they are cute and “new” but the price tag given to Little Printer made the product even more difficult to sell. Berg’s CEO also admitted that one of the main reasons for his company's failure was that they priced their products at above the level of consumer’s willingness to pay, $259; pretty expensive for a toy."

Alikolo,Online marketplace organization,e-Commerce,Indonesia,2014,2015,Shut Down,Lack of Experience,1,Danny Taniwan,10-Jan,1,$100K,1,"Alikolo was an eMarketplace organization started in 2014, in Indonesia. The organization's goal was to address purchasers' issues from an online stage. Alikolo’s model was such that sellers could list their product in the e-marketplace and buyers could access the sites to make their purchases. Alikolo would then ensure that the items purchased from the online stage would be delivered to their remote destinations. Initially, they incentivized the delivery by offering free shipping but when the shipping promotion stopped, their sales dropped significantly.","As a matter of first importance, the author, Taniwan did not have a clear vision of the quality of the organization in connection to its rivals and that might be because its eMarketplace idea lacked uniqueness. This is highlighted by Taniwan inability to give a reason for which a customer should purchase at Alikolo specifically instead of purchasing from their rivals.

One of the significant slip-ups that Alikolo made was to offer the greater part of the organization’s stake to speculators. This put the founder as a minority investor and limited its involvement and influence in some aspects of the business. This kind of business structure, where the CEO becomes a minority investor frightened off other potential speculators and therefore, Alikolo failed to secure a second round of financing. This eventually prompted absence of adequate assets that could have been used to scale up the organization and assemble an aggressive and more successful platform. Ultimately, the major obstacles that Alikolo faced were internal since it had its leadership lacked experience in both designing and running an organization."
HitMeUp,Developed mobile marketing applications,e-Commerce,United Kingdom,2011,2015,Shut Down,Lack of Focus,1,Charlie Pool,10-Jan,1,£50K,1,"HitMeUp was a web-based business commercial center situated in London. Its zone of specialization was instant and area-based promotions. The business application enabled clients to make area-based flash deals when it experienced low sales periods. HitMeUp had also a customer's application that gave clients the ability to see a map of flash sales and deals around them. The main objective of the app was that of connecting business with clients that were looking for deals and were ready to buy on the spot thanks to its real-time and location-based service. HitMeUp advanced through three forms; Version 1 - Web-only application, Version 2 - Mobile application in addition to Web, and Version 3 - Mobile application only.","By its own admission, HitMeUp founder had no tech background when he launched the startup. Although he was well versed in the business management side and had the capital to develop his idea early on, his total dependence on someone else to develop his vision proved to be a risky thing. His idea took too much time to see the light and this brought about inflated costs.

When they finally launched Version 1, they discovered that businesses were particularly bad at selling their own product, and published post and promotions that were badly written and accompanied them with unappealing photographs of the products they were trying to sell. Furthermore, when they had a sale they didn’t want to promote it to their customers and thus lose clients who would have paid the full price for the item. They expected HitMeUp to attract a new customer base they could then sell to.

This problem was solved in the second Version where the startup provided a customer-oriented app through which businesses could promote their sales directly on the mobile environment for HitMeUp users to discover and take advantage of.

Another problem the team discovered was that using Facebook online business proved to be both awkward and not carefully conceived as people when on the platform to get in touch with their friends and usually weren’t in the particular mood for shopping, and if they were, they often ended up buying from their trusted platforms.

Finally, when experimenting with the third Version of their product, they focused on a mobile-only application, which again proved unsuccessful. The app had plenty of businesses of all type of sort that were ready to sign up, but the startup hadn’t done extensive marketing outreach for their business and their users were few to enable them to scale up and sustain their business model. When business discovered that no one showed up to redeem their coupons, they would understandably stop using the app. The failure of all the three versions eventually led to the closure of the company but was definitely an enhancing experience for the HitMeUp team."
Monitor110,Real-time internet monitoring services,Analytics,United States,2003,2008,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Roger Ehrenberg,10-Jan,3,$17.3M,4,Monitor 110 was an information and data gathering service that offered real-time internet monitoring services for Wall Street. It allowed investors to monitor internet sources for information and insight relevant to their investment and portfolio management. Their algorithm allowed customers to gather data and monitor 40 million online sources so as to get first knowledge of any new trend by essentially ‘listening in’ to online conversations and blogs that included keywords related to the financial market.,"Monitor 110 closed down its operations in July 2008 due to various reasons.

First, there wasn’t a clear leadership at the top levels. Monitor110 was directed by two people that had completely different backgrounds - which is not a bad thing - but that also had different perspectives when it came to decision making. The company also waited too much before releasing their product also due to the fact that they received substantial publicity (for example, they were featured by the Financial Times) before they had a thoroughly tested release. This got people’s expectation high and made the company reluctant to release a less than perfect product. The fact that they received $17 million might have also been counterproductive for them, as instead of building a lean beta version they kept developing the product in a vacuum based on their vision for it rather than receiving valuable feedback from customers. A technical problem they also faced was related to the amount of spam and duplicate posts that the algorithm was picking up on, it was too much and it could have diminished the value of the platform. When they finally decided on a suitable business pivot after months of indecisiveness, the company had already started running out of money and there was an unpleasant tension between the company team. The company lost also the edge they could have had in such a competitive market as theirs and decided to shut their operations in 2008."
Juicero,First home cold-pressed juicing system,Food & Beverage,United States,2013,2017,Bankruptcy,Bad Business Model,1,Doug Evans,100-250,4,$118.5M,16,"Juicero was a juice company that collected fresh organic fruits and vegetables for the customers, prepared, and put them in special single serve packets. It offered pre-sold packets of diced fruits and vegetables. It solved the produce gap and ensured that it took care of the washing, cutting preparing for people to eat in a simple way. It brought convenience to the people by using a Wi-Fi connected juice press that automatically squeezed the single servings packets into a glass of cold fresh juice. Juicero stated mission was helping people attain optimal health by making it easier for them to consume fresh raw foods.","Juicero failed to build a profitable business after raising a substantial amount of funds under the claim of innovation and disruption. The company received funding from high profile firms before users realized that the machines were useless.

The high initial price of $699 was already a barrier for many of its potential customers and the fact that the machine only worked with Wi-Fi was an additional inconvenience. To add to that, the company put a scannable QR code on each packet serving and the machine would not function unless it detected the presence of said code. In other words, people could not press home-made packets but had to order them from Juicero, each packet costed between $5 and $7. After months of slow sales, the company tried to sell its product at $400 and planned to offer a cheaper version in the months to come.

The company received one last blow when Bloomberg News published a video proving that simply by hand squeezing the packets you could obtain a full glass of juice and that the $700 machine was really useless. Few months after that, Juicero went bankrupt and has since been classified as another absurd Silicon Valley startup product that raised huge funds but didn’t really solve any real problem."
Salorix,Online social network engagement platform,Analytics,United States,2009,2014,Shut Down,Bad Management,1,Santanu Bhattacharya,Oct-50,2,$3.5M,2,"Salorix was an agency that offered an online networking engagement platform for brands. Through Amplify, as the AI based service was called, brands could “listen in” on ongoing social discussions which would be ranked to distinguish the most relevant key themes and influencers over different businesses for their clients. Solarix was considered to have a cutting-edge product and even received twice acquisition offers from Google in 2012 and 2013.","Salorix closed down because of inability to raise reserves after its major investors stopped supporting it. This was following a disagreement between the founder and investors over securing an offer from Google. The investors were excited about the Google offer and saw it as a good business opportunity while the Salorix founder was not awed with it.

Rumors have it that Salorix CEO asked for a higher price but Google refused and the deal didn’t go through. Soon after it was clear that the founder would not listen to their wishes and advice, investors put a stop to any additional financial support (after having initially backed up the startup with $3.5 million in Series A investment).

It was widely popular in the Asian region and boasted about 115 million registered users in 2011. Through the platform, users could take part in online games, send messages, write comments, post media and share content with other users publicly or privately. It was also used for dating, discovering new events and joining new hobbyist circles.","Friendster seemed like a fun place to hang out, with all the right bells and whistles to lead the way. What went wrong then?

Friendster did two things particularly well: it offered social gaming and it gave users reasons to keep coming back to its platform. What it seemed to have missed creating, instead,was an actual social network. If one had to point out a major point that made Facebook soar, and that Friendster and other similar sites didn’t catch up with, was the presence and the emphasis put on the social news feed feature.

Gaming is fun, but only until a certain point, while social interactions - of any kind, really - are always sought after by people. By making the news feed the central part of its platform, Facebook ensured that people always had new things to interact with that somehow was still connected to them or their circle of friends. It offered a never-ending stream of new posts and pictures to like or comment on and it shifted away from the previous focus which was to curate and polish one’s own profile, which was exactly still one of Friendster’s focus. User use and registration declined and the company struggled to regain influence and shutdown."

Digg,Enables users to share interesting stories,Social Media,United States,2004,Active,Still Active,Competition,1,Kevin Rose,50-100,6,$49M,14,Digg stated mission on launching was that of ‘democratizing’ the content and news that people saw. The concept was simple: anyone that found interesting content could ‘digg it’ and post it on the Digg site. The post and stories that received the most amount of upvotes were featured on Digg’s front page getting thus maximum exposure. The site was initially a place for geeky and tech content but it soon grew to incorporate various types of content.,"Digg is a site that missed the opportunity to become a thriving social network. The site is still active but even one of its former CEOs posts more frequently on Twitter than on his own site.

The reason Digg failed were interlinked and quite obvious to point out in hindsight.

First of all, it failed to carry on with its mission of offering a platform that was free of any group’s agenda. As a matter of fact, anyone with a large circle of friends or with a numerous follower’s base (or the highest number of fake accounts) could message their posts to get the most amount of upvotes within hours, not because of the quality of the content of the post, but simply because of the connections that that specific ‘power user’ had. In an attempt to remedy to this, the site disabled the messaging feature it had and only allowed sharing with their friends by means of Facebook and Twitter. As you can imagine, the move didn’t do them any good, not only that, but it left their users dissatisfied (to say the least) by the newly implemented restriction.

And yet, these were not the only changes Digg’s team made that distanced its users. In 2010, Digg came back with a new design that, alas, had even fewer features. Digg v4, as it was called, did away with features such as down voting posts, saving favorites and posting videos.

Digg had the advantage of being the early mover since it was founded in 2004 and valued at $160 million in 2008, but it failed to adapt to its growing user base and renew the mission it had. Another bookmarking site, Reddit, slowly but inevitably started to catch up with it. As Digg users left the platform in 2010, there was Reddit offering them a ready and welcoming alternative. The interesting and inviting thing about Reddit, which is basically a spinoff of Digg, was that user content was encouraged and this allowed the platform to thrive. Self-promotion and publishing of one’s own content on Digg, instead, seemed to be frowned upon. Reddit valued and nurtured its community in ways Digg wasn’t able to do.

There were rumors that Digg would be brought back and improved upon as an app, but even so, by now it would face quite a bit of competition."

MatterFab,Selling affordable solutions for metal 3-D printing,Software & Hardware,United States,2013,2019,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,1,Matthew Burris,10-Jan,3,$13.2M,7,"The world of additive manufacturing has widely been promoted as the embodiment of the future. 3D printers are the machines that are making this into a reality. Using metal as the raw material for printing has made 3D printing more than just a hobby. Airline juggernauts like Airbus and General Electric have been replacing traditionally made engine parts with lighter, 3D printed ones. This saves them millions in fuel costs. The major downside to all this has been the $1 million price tag. MatterFab, founded in 2013, came to the rescue with the goal of making metal-based additive manufacturing affordable.","The Seattle based startup had a promising pitch and a noble cause - Making metal-based additive manufacturing an affordable reality. The company had stated that this is because of the experience of the team, which allows them to pull a dozen different engineering disciplines together and come up with workable solutions. MatterFab had initially shown serious promise, as their 3D printers were supposed to be about 10% of the price of a regular metal 3D printer.

MatterFab received $7.48M funding in February 2015. This was followed by $5.75M in May of that year, making the startup one of the most funded new enterprises in the 3D printing industry. Investors included GE and AutoDesk.

One cause for the failure of this once-promising startup can be stated in the words of Josh Ewing from AutoDesk - “We believed in MatterFab’s approach and vision, but unfortunately it didn’t succeed in the marketplace.”

Dave Warren, who is the co-founder and former CTO had left MatterFab in March 2016 to pursue a career with a Stealth Drone Startup. The other co-founder, Matt Burris had already left in October 2015. The reasoning from the investors' perspectives was that they needed a more experienced management team to lead the business. That team that followed them included Matt Paterson (the CTO brought in to replace Warren), but Patterson himself left MatterFab in March 2017.

A deeper problem besides this was the sad financial state of the company. With over $13 million raised since February 2015, the company appears to have burned through over half a million a month in 2016 alone!

Also, with GE purchasing established metal AM enterprises (like Concept Laser and Arcam) and their plans to launch the world’s largest metal 3D printer (ATLAS), their initial enthusiasm in investing in MatterFab may have evaporated before things could take-off successfully."
WOW Air,Ultra-low-cost transatlantic airline service,Transportation,Iceland,2011,2019,Bankruptcy,Multiple Reasons,1,Skuli Mogensen,50-100,1,-,1,"WOW Air was the Icelandic answer to RyanAir for low-cost air travel in Europe. Founded in 2011, it operated between Iceland, Europe, Asia, and North America. In 2012 WOW Air took over operations and flight network from another home-grown low-cost carrier, Iceland Express. The airline carried over 400,000 passengers in 2013 and reached its 1 millionth passenger on December 2014. By 2015, WOW Air had expanded its flight operations to North America, with flights to the U.S. starting in 2015, followed by Canada in May 2016. Within the next 2 years, it would also add more destinations in the Middle East as well, like Tel Aviv, Israel.","In the first few years that it started operations, WOW Air delighted their US travelers with the prospect of below $100 flights to Europe. How true was it? Well, in 2017, WOW Air was accused of spreading false claims, after media outlets reported its claim that it would fly passengers from London to New York for £99, which it said was below cost. That flight leg, priced at £99, was only available as part of a more expensive return flight!

Aside from these false rumors and claims, which some may say are a common thing within the airline industry anyways, there are some bigger reasons.

In a Financial Times interview, WOW Air CEO Skuli Mogensen stated that the reason the airline essentially failed was their decision to hire a fleet of wide-body Airbus A330s (which added up to significantly higher fuel costs). He also stated in that interview that this decision, which turned out to be a final nail in the coffin for WOW Air, was taken while there was too much debt on the balance sheet and given the challenging environment in the airline industry, they could not secure further funding.

It's true that the ultra-low-cost airline industry, especially in Europe faces a challenging environment. Since the summer of 2018, 8 European airlines had failed according to an article by Bloomberg (with most blames going towards rising fuel prices). The case of WOW Air is nothing new in these regards.

The unique case of the spectacular failure of WOW Air can be frankly described in one sentence - They wanted to become too big too fast.

Within a short span of time, since they started in 2011, WOW Air was reportedly planning to add 15 destinations in Asia just before going bankrupt. With just 10 planes, they planned to cover 30 destinations (no wonder they averaged 15-30 minutes late for most of their flights). By comparison Southwest Airlines a US-based low-cost carrier has 750 planes for 100 destinations. They also overthought the importance of Iceland as a destination for stopovers on transatlantic flights, while acting as if they were too big to fail, and thought that somehow the Iceland government, given the importance of tourism in the country, would bail them out of their debt burdens.

Aria Insights,Air vehicles for search and rescue missions,Software & Hardware,United States,2008,2019,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Helen Greiner,Oct-50,7,$39M,8,"Aria, formerly known as CyPhy Works was a US-based drone manufacturer that specialized in developing highly advanced drones. Their flagship product was called PARC - Persistent Aerial Reconnaissance and Communication, and was a tethered drone that had a particularly long flight time - instead of hours one could measure it in days. The drone was also known for its ability to sustain harsh weather conditions, making it perfect for “rough use”. As such, many of Aria’s clients were related to law enforcement and the military. Aria also targeted clients related to first response, telecommunications and the oil and gas industry.","There are various reasons why Aria ultimately failed. What they all have in common is that they’re complex in and of themselves. For example, Aria’s founder, Helen Greiner left the company back in 2018. When a company loses its founder, momentum shifts. The core philosophy of the company is being “sucked out” and replaced by someone else. 

Naturally, that’s likely not the only reason. Another reason could have been Aria’s decision to move away from producing drones and drone technology to focusing on developing smart AI systems and drone programs. Aria re-launched in January 2019 and said that a number of their partners were focused on collecting and storing massive amounts of information using Aria’s drones. However, nobody could offer Aria’s partners the possibility to quickly turn the data into actionable insights.

Aria discovered a new possibility in the market that nobody else was offering at that time. And for sure, looking for new ways to serve their clients is always a healthy sign, but this time, Aria took things a little too far.

Since there was no other company offering that particular service, it might have been a sign that demand really wasn’t that big after all. And Aria might have gotten the wrong impression that since their actual partners craved the technology to store and interpret massive amounts of information, that was also the case with the rest of the drone market.

Ultimately that proved not to be the case and quite likely, commercial demand and regulations were just too slow to catch up with the supply of drone solutions.

It’s an example where a company offers a solution to a problem that really doesn’t exist yet on such a large scale that it’s possible to monetize from it. In other words, the company was way ahead of itself."
Vreal,VR game-streaming platform,Entertainment,United States,2015,Active,Shut Down,Bad Timing,1,Todd Hooper,Oct-50,3,$15M,13,"Started in 2015, Vreal was a virtual reality startup that enabled users to create avatars and interact with content creators and players on a shared VR space. The startup managed to snag more than $15 million from VC firms including Axioma Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Intel Capital. Vreal allowed players to watch immersive content while being inside the game, think of it as ‘Twitch for VR’ (Twitch is a live-streaming platform for gamers). They had more than two dozen employees before they decided to shut shop in August 2019.","The startup themselves admitted that they were ahead of their time with a product whose market was never fully developed. They expected the VR market to grow at a much faster rate, but it didn’t happen at the speed they expected.  

The virtual reality headset market had four consecutive quarters of decline before it returned to show signs of growth in Q3 2018. Enterprises have opened themselves up to adopting VR for its uses in different industries like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and firms that want to provide a different customer experience. But consumers haven’t cozied up to it because of its steep price and inability to understand how to use it. In other words, VR hasn’t gone mainstream yet.

Vreal’s failure looks more like collateral damage to the downward slide that the VR industry faced. It just wasn’t time. Its founder, Todd Hooper, has founded and operated a lot of companies in the entertainment space, including gaming. It looks like he had the right set of skills to win at a startup in this space. Vreal is the story of a company that was in the right place at the wrong time. 

Vreal’s competitor Virtalis develops visualization systems for defense, construction and military sectors. This is an indicator of how a product pivot could have saved Vreal. Since there were very few VR headset manufacturers at that time, like HTC, Oculus, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Sony, the price of these products wasn’t affordable for the majority as well. The fact that VR headsets weren’t cheap (they still aren’t) just added to Vreal’s problem as they insisted on having the VR hardware to be able to enjoy the content thus limiting their reach. 

Also, remember that Vreal operated in a sub-niche with a product that wasn’t widely adopted yet. There were just too many things that didn’t fall into place for Vreal to succeed. The adoption of VR technology will not die down as it holds significant potential for the long-term. We will soon see more startups in the VR headset space, especially for the gaming fans. "
Radar Radio,UK digital radio station,Entertainment,United Kingdom,2008,2018,Shut Down,Mismanagement of Funds,1,Ollie Ashley,Oct-50,0,-,0,"Radar Radio was a London-based and seemingly vibrant online radio station that was seen to be the breeding ground for some of the most talented broadcasters and musicians of the next generation. The station was renowned for hosting shows that highlighted established as well as new musical talent. Some of the guests that were hosted on these shows include the likes of  JME, Cardi B, and MIA. The station was owned by Ollie Ashley and mainly appealed to the youth across different racial devices, and especially people of color.","At the start of 2018, Radar Radio would no doubt be counted among the most exciting digital radio stations in the UK. However, later on, it started spiraling towards its destruction when allegations of internal exploitation started surfacing. For instance, in April of 2018, local DJ Pxssy Palace accused the station of stealing many ideas from people of color and exploiting marginalized groups for “capitalist purposes.” During this period, many DJs, producers, presenters, and other employees left the station, before its broadcasting was suspended on April 16th with the promise to investigate the allegations. 

The station was also engrossed in accusations of sexual harassment. For instance, there were claims of female employees being inappropriately touched while on duty. Unfortunately, all these accusations were swept under the carpet under the pretext of the confidentiality agreement. A former producer, Ashtart Al-Hurra, published a blog post detailing what she had experienced at Radar Radio. In her post, she claims to have been sexually harassed by DJs at the station and associated events. On top of this, some of her colleagues were rumored to have slept with some of them. 

Besides the numerous accusations, the company also had its fair share of financial struggles. For instance, its balance sheet indicated that Radar owed its creditors more than £4m, with this sum falling due just within one year of the period that ended in April 2017. Out of this amount, around £3.6m was owed to Mash Holdings, Radar’s parent company, and over £400,000 to trade creditors. 

All these factors combined saw Radar Radio, a seemingly promising and profitable venture close its operations. However, until today, their management has not released any official communication about the reopening or resolution of the mentioned issues."
Theranos,Consumer healthcare technology company,Health,United States,2003,2018,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,1,Elizabeth Holmes,Oct-50,10,$1.4B,16,"Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, biotech upstart Theranos claimed to have devised a way to predict the onset of life-threatening diseases using just small amounts of blood samples—their revolutionary technology requiring only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed for pre-existing tests. It then recommended preventative medical cures based on those results. Theranos was hailed as a revolutionary startup that raised more than $700 million in venture capital and private investor funding. At its peak around 2014, the company was valued at a whopping $10 billion.","Elizabeth Holmes was a real sensation in the media, often featured on the covers of various business magazines and lists of top executives and innovators. On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase ""if only I had known sooner."" 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, Bad Blood, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early ""disgruntled employees"" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry.

Stratolaunch,Launching rockets into space from airplanes,Transportation,United States,2010,2019,Shut Down,Lack of Focus,1,Paul Allen,"500-1,000",0,-,0,"Stratolaunch was started as an ambitious project by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan (Founder of Scaled Composites) in 2010. The idea was to utilize the strategy of using a carrier aircraft to launch orbital rockets from the stratosphere. This would give rockets an altitude and speed boost, and supposedly reduce costs in the process.

Following on the footsteps of what SpaceX achieved by privatizing space travel, Stratolaunch wanted to repeat that success with orbital rockets. They first successfully took off on April 13, 2019. However, barely 2 months after that first successful flight, the Seattle based startup that had the brains and capital from the best of Silicon Valley behind it, ceased operations and was put up for sale in June 2019.","Despite everything looking great on paper and the best of minds working together on this project, nothing could have predicted Paul Allen’s passing away in October of 2018, which would soon spell out the same fate for Stratolaunch. It became clear that Stratolaunch had been powered only by the vision of its founder, which wasn't necessarily shared by those left in power after him.

In January 2019, rather than scaling back their proposed set of booster-rockets, Stratolaunch scrapped them all. There was to be no space plane, no boosters and no PGA booster (which were proposals of Paul Allen). Instead, the company declared that the giant plane (the Stratolaunch) would be used to launch the much smaller Pegasus XL rocket, a bizarre proposal for a rocket that could already be launched from a much more conventional aircraft. I guess they just wanted to put up a final spectacular show for the viewers by sending the plane with the longest wingspan (the 117m Stratolaunch) towards its successful maiden (and last) flight before completely shutting down.

With a lack of vision and no clear direction, the company became a profligate project that soon burnt the billions that it had received from Vulcan Inc, which was Paul Allen’s investment arm. What can ultimately be said about Stratolaunch is that the company was never the same without its key founder, Paul Allen. Think of Apple if Steve Jobs never returned after being fired.

The lack of enthusiasm for Stratolaunch from the rest of the company's employees killed the project before it could even really take off seriously and the Pegasus XL flight test for their carrier was all that the company could do in tribute of its late founder. The proverbial “Tim Cook” of Stratolaunch (Vulcan Inc. CEO Bill Hilf) did not prove to be much of a success either. It was one thing to manage investments of the likes that Vulcan Inc. dealt with, but an entirely different story when you do not have the same passion for tech as the person that mentored you. In June 2019 the Stratolaunch Systems company and assets were put up for sale by Vulcan Inc. for $400 million, (the hefty price tag includes the plane as well as the intellectual property and other facilities). The company successfully transitioned ownership in October of 2019 but hasn’t named the owner so far."
Seven Dreamers Laboratories,"Robot that washes, dries and irons clothes",Software & Hardware,Japan,2014,2019,Bankruptcy,Poor Product,1,Shin Sakane,100-250,3,$95M,4,"Ever since the word “robot” was coined from the Czech word Robota as a reference to forced labor, inventors have been trying to bring it to reality. Robots have become an essential component in factories, assembly lines, and other areas where repetitive and tough labor is needed. Their resilience has ensured their success and popularity not as slaves but as a super-productive replacement for their human counterparts.

Robots designed are yet to become an essential part of our home and everyday life, but that still hasn’t deterred companies from trying to develop the perfect home servant. After the success of Roomba as a robot vacuum cleaner, it was the turn of Seven Dreamers Laboratory to come up with a robot that, according to their claim, washed, dried, ironed and even folded laundry.

During their business lifetime, Seven Dreamers received $89 million in venture capital, partnered with Panasonic and Daiwa House Industries Corporation, and even premiered at the 2015 CEATEC consumer electronics show in Tokyo inevitably hyping up the launch of their Laundroid.","Robots have traditionally had a hard time breaking into domestic servitude. Today they can vacuum floors, mop tiles, and even mow the lawn successfully. However, when it comes to other tasks like home security or simple companionship, they have a long way to go despite major developments in emotionally intelligent robots.

Seven Dreamers made a lot of lofty promises about the capabilities of their Laundroid robot built to “save us” from one of our most mundane task routines: doing laundry. They lauded their image recognition, artificial intelligence, and dexterous handling mechanisms that enabled Laundroid to both fold and organize a pile of clean laundry. 

In reality, it required the cleaned and dried laundry to be pre-prepped for folding. So users still needed to do at least part of the work rather than the collective image of expectation to be able to just open the dryer and toss clothing directly into the Laundroid and be greeted by freshly folded clothes. In any case, the $16,000 price tag could never be justified for such a machine.

What is interesting to note is that in 2019, the same year that Laundroid shut down, it was boldly promising that they could lower down the cost of this home robot to just $1000. However, by the time the company shut down, it was barely 5 years old and touted as a major failure with its ridiculous idea rather than a kickstart to the robotics revolution for personal home assistants.

The cause of failure can be simply stated as a failure of product strategy. The product that was launched was extremely expensive for the service that it provided and it simply could not match the human dexterity that a simple task like folding laundry required. I guess we all have to be doing our own laundry for the next foreseeable future after all. 

It is interesting to note that Laundroid’s competitor, Foldimate, has a working prototype that can fold a shirt in 5 seconds. They also know that no one is going to buy the machine until they bring the price down (It is currently looking to enter the market priced at $980). However, clothes have to be fed into the machine one at a time. It will be very interesting to see which way it goes if it is ever released into the consumer market.  "

Upon shutdown, Google sent emails to users claiming that the app is obsolete since location sharing is integrated into Google maps.

That said, this comparison is not entirely fair, since Google Maps location sharing doesn’t allow your contacts to receive your location on demand. This makes it much less useful if you find yourself in a dangerous situation and are unable to proactively share your location with your contacts (e.g. you are unconscious, etc.). At the same time, Trusted Contacts didn’t have an always-on location setting like the one in Google Maps.

The current Pixel-exclusive Personal Safety app has a similar goal to the one of Trusted Contacts, but instead of sharing location on demand, it allows you to schedule a safety check that will alert your contacts if you don’t answer.

Quibi,Short-form streaming platform,Entertainment,United States,2018,2020,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Jeffrey Katzenberg,250-500,2,$1.8B,14,"In short, Quibi was Netflix for your phone. For $5 with ads or $8 without ads per month, you got access to a library of video content specifically made to be watched on mobile devices - mostly fictional series, but also news shows and recaps called daily essentials as well as reality shows, etc.

The two main unique selling points of the service were that the content could be watched both in landscape and in portrait mode and that the episodes were short enough (from 5 to 15 minutes) to be watched while on the move - e.g. when commuting by train, waiting in a line, etc. The premise of the streaming service was that the existing solutions were not convenient to watch on mobile phones while on the go, which left a hole in the market.

The name Quibi derived from Quick Bites, the name that the service gave to these short ~10-minute episodes.

‍","1) Coronavirus
""I attribute everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus"" (source).

This line by Katzenberg is commonly quoted when Quibi’s failure is discussed, even though later on he walked back on his statement and said “Simply to blame it on COVID is not fair, and not something either of us (Whitman and him) want to do” (source).

The pandemic was the obvious, easy excuse that allowed the executive team to save face. People’s routine changed, and the train and subway commutes and queues in shops that Quibi was counting on became much rarer.

Yet, TikTok usage was growing during the pandemic, and presumably, TikTok relies on mobile usage just as much as Quibi. This is a clear indicator that people didn’t entirely stop using their phones in favor of their TVs and PCs because of COVID, and even though the Coronavirus might have made Quibi’s life more complicated, it’s obviously not the sole reason for the app’s failure.

‍

2) Content
If you are searching for a single major reason for the app’s failure, it is content.

After all, it’s a video-on-demand service, and if people find value in it depends entirely on the content it provides - its quality and scope.

Simply calling the shows bad is too subjective, but the consensus seems to strongly point in that direction.

Quibi was mass-buying all content that it could get its hands on because it needed to build a large enough library to compete with other streaming services. Naturally, needing a lot of content fast means you can’t have extremely high standards: “If we have a show that’s going to be a huge hit, you pitch to Netflix, HBO. If it doesn’t get traction, you pitch to Quibi” (source).

Going after projects that Netflix and HBO rejected, however, has another implication - these projects were not created with Quibi’s short-form format in mind. The service bought feature-length movies, and chopped them into pieces to make a “series”. Naturally, this approach doesn’t give great results, and could easily turn an OK movie into a frustrating watching experience.

That said, the fact that there was a lot of bad content on the platform wouldn’t be that much of a problem if there was one amazing show that was a must-watch. Streaming services need a killer show just as much as platforms need a killer app.

Quibi’s competition is well aware of this - when Game of Thrones was on its last episodes, HBO made a huge effort to advertise its other content because it realized very well that a lot of people were subscribed just to watch Game of Thrones. Thankfully for HBO, they had another big hit, Chernobyl, very shortly after the conclusion of Game of Thrones.

Quibi never had a killer show. What this means is that it never had a real reason for people to subscribe.

‍

3) Marketing
It seems that Quibi entirely missed the point that people subscribed to their streaming services because of the content, rather than the service itself. All of Quibi’s marketing efforts were focused on the platform and its uniqueness, rather than on its best shows.

Moreover, Quibi’s promotional efforts were more reminiscent of the ad campaigns of traditional brick and mortar businesses rather than the social-heavy, virality-based, low CAC campaigns of B2C tech startups.

A great example is the expensive Superbowl ad that Quibi launched before it was even available. 


Another is its Oscars ad. Both seemed to be driven by ego rather than by a good understanding of Quibi’s audience. The service was targeting millennials, yet the average Oscars viewer is in their 50s.

In unconfirmed market research after the two ads, 70 percent of respondents said they thought Quibi was a food-delivery service (source).

‍

4) Features
Quibi’s failure to understand and connect to its target audience was just as apparent in its (lack of) features as it was in its marketing.

Quibi was a mobile app for content, yet for a long time, it didn’t allow users to easily take clips and screenshots that could be shared on social media. Quibi failed to understand that a large segment of their users wanted to turn what they were watching into content for their own social media and that these were their most important users who would actively bring more people to their service.

So, Quibi not only failed to actively advertise their content, but the service prevented the content from spreading naturally through virality.

The exclusive focus on mobile was a deliberate decision - Quibi didn’t want to compete directly with Netflix, it wanted to focus on its USP, which was short drama content for your phone. Yet, the decision backfired because the pandemic meant more people were stuck at home. Quibi introduced the ability to broadcast content to your TV, but this feature came too late to make a major difference.

Moreover, the focus on mobile meant that Quibi was actually competing directly for screen time with two other video-on-demand giants: TikTok and YouTube, which have the big benefit that they are free (later on, Quibi experimented with a free pricing tier in New Zealand, but the results weren’t good enough to give hope for the service).

Last but not least, the service’s major innovative feature, the ability to watch a show on your phone both horizontally and vertically, was also very problematic. It’s easy to argue that it is a gimmick and it’s questionable if it adds any real value. This is a problem because the feature requires anyone developing content for Quibi to develop it with both portrait and landscape in mind, adding a layer of complexity. Moreover, as we already mentioned, a lot of the content on the platform wasn’t created specifically for Quibi. This means that it wasn’t created with this feature in mind, and for a large chunk of the content portrait mode simply didn’t work as well as landscape.

‍

5) Leadership Problems
In fact, it is quite apparent Quibi’s leadership was far removed from their audience and the tech world as a whole. When asked about her favorite show, Whitman said that she wasn’t sure she would call herself an entertainment enthusiast, but she liked Grant on The History Channel (source). It’s quite obvious she didn’t consume what she was selling - first, she didn’t give a Quibi show as an example, and second, she admitted not to consume too much entertainment content as a whole.

Being in their sixties, it’s obvious that the two company leaders were far removed from their target audience. The problem is that they didn’t seem to think so themselves. The same Vulture feature quotes a person with first-hand experience at the company: “Unless you agree with them, you’re a troublemaker. Meg believes she’s a marketing genius; Jeffrey believes he’s a content genius. So you end up in shitty jobs where you’re there to execute their vision, which no one else there believes in.”

As if this wasn’t a strong enough red flag, it seems the two leaders were in a clash themselves, as Whitman complained that Katzenberg was undermining her authority (source).

‍

6) Lack of Problem Validation
The fact that the service came out of Hollywood rather than Silicon Valley was probably beneficial in terms of content but detrimental in terms of properly running an innovative startup.

Why do people need Quibi? Maybe if people have a few minutes to kill on their phone, they’d prefer watching video content on TikTok and YouTube rather than drama series.

Quibi never ran an MVP (minimum viable product) or any experimental public beta to try to test what kind of content and what kind of features resonated well with their target users.

The assumption that people would like to watch short drama series episodes when they had a few minutes to kill on their phone wasn’t validated. Because of this, Katzenberg and co. were essentially running a $2B dollar high-risk experiment. These kinds of experiments could have been run for much, much cheaper under the lean startup principles - an industry-standard in the startup world.

The biggest startup mistake is to build something nobody needs, and 34% of startups fail due to lack of product-market fit. It’s hard to argue that Quibi doesn’t fall into this category. It’s easy to imagine that chopping up a movie into 20 pieces doesn’t add any real value.

‍

7) Overfunding
Overfunding was not the reason for Quibi’s failure, but it was the reason for the service to shut down.

A lot of startups would kill to have 500k people paying $5 or $8 per month for their service, but 500k subscribers with no indicators of growth are simply not enough to pay for a $2B investment.

By raising close to $2B before even launching, Quibi put itself in a position in which it would either become one of the major players on the streaming market, or it would be forced to shut down.

It’s plausible that there is a market niche for a mobile-first streaming service but it’s unlikely to be big enough to bring a company to the size of Netflix or HBO. By fundraising in a more conventional manner (pre-seed and seed for validation experiments, series A, B, C, etc. for scaling), Quibi might have become a profitable, albeit smaller streaming service. Equally importantly, it could have done it without burning close to $2B (most of which on content) along the way. "
Google Glass,Wearable computing device,Software & Hardware,United States,2013,2015,Shut Down,Poor Product,1,Google,"10,000",0,-,0,"On June 27th, 2012, Google launched an outbreaking tech product, in the style of an invention you might have seen in Mission Impossible and Black Mirror: Google Glass.

This wearable that came in the form of an optical head-mounted display, enabled wearers to check messages, view photos, and search the Internet, among other features - everything controlled by their voice and motion.","1. Overpromise
To reinforce that the device was still work in progress, Google Glass was first sold to a selected group of geeks and journalists, instead of launching it in retail stores.

However, the strategy backfired them, as the esclusivity this small group had, added interest within the rest of the mortals and the media.

The scene-stealing presentation of the device and the high price also generated a lot of buzz and expectation for the Google Glass.

However, the delivered product wasn’t capable of doing some of the things promoted and it contained a lot of bugs. It’s not a surprise to read that a tech reviewer classified it as “the worst product of all time”.

‍

2. Design
Google Glass’ design was critized just from the beginning. The device looked really different to a conventional pair of glasses. Many people particularly disliked its bulky frame.

Google aimed to turn the device into something cool to wear, by partnering up with fashion icons and events. However, many people realized about this strategy and kept to think Google glasses looked too geeky.

‍

3. Privacy Concerns
The built-in camera was one of the most promoted features of the Google Glass. But at the same time, one of the most controversial characteristics.

It was invasive as the people that the Google glasses recorded hadn’t given the person the permission to do it.

This lead to people getting agressive at those wearing Google glasses as well as many places, including Las Vegas casinos, bars and theatres, among others, to forbid the device inside them.

‍

4. No Need
Google glasses were something nice to have, but definitely not a necessity (like mobile phones are) for most of the users.

At the same time, Glass was competing with other devices that had longer battery, better cameras, larger capacity and quicker processors.

This, summed up to the fact that the price was $1,500, made it nonsense to purchase it.

Google Inbox,Email service from Google,Productivity,United States,2014,2019,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,1,Google,"10,000",0,-,0,"Back in 2014, Google did something unexpected: they launched a new email app called Inbox.

It was basically a Gmail alternative, that worked with the user’s existing Gmail address. However, it was designed around a completely different philosophy about what email is and how to manage it.","The app was discontinued at the end of March 2019.

Google Inbox Discontinued
In April of the previous year, Google had launched a re-designed Gmail, with many new features. According to Google product manager Matthew Izatt, the company was looking for a “more focused approach” to email, which probably led them to focusing on Gmail rather than Inbox.

What most journalists claim is that the Inbox app became unnecessary, up to Google’s decision-makers’ view, and they decided to stick to Gmail."

""After much thought and consideration, we’ve decided to retire Picasa over the coming months in order to focus entirely on a single photo service in Google Photos. We believe we can create a much better experience by focusing on one service that provides more functionality and works across mobile and desktop, rather than divide our efforts across two different products.""

Despite such elaborate controls, the company was forced to shut down for various reasons. The main reason that HiGear lists as having prompted them to stop the business was when a criminal gang stole four cars that had a combined worth of $400,000. The criminals succeeded in the scheme by using stolen identities to evade the company's background check controls. In an email to its customers, HiGear stated that it had the duty to protect its customers and that it opted to shut down operations until they were able to put in place proper countermeasures.

Secret,Online platform to share personal secrets,Social Media,United States,2013,2015,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,2,"Chrys Bader-Wechseler, David Byttow",Oct-50,3,$35M,21,Secret was an Android and iOS app that allowed users to post content anonymously with their circle of friends or share it with a wider public. The app gained interest - and was at one point valued at 100 million- because it provided an outlet to those that didn’t want to be bound by the ‘real name’ rule of other social applications and face consequences for sharing their opinions and preferences. It also distinguished itself from other anonymous apps in that its interest factor for users could be higher since they knew that the person that shared a certain post on the app was someone that was in their contact list or circle of friends. The app became very addictive and some users said they routinely went through the motion of uninstalling the app only to install it again soon after that. The app was especially used in Silicon Valley.,"The number of active users of the app rapidly declined after only 18 months from its launch.

After the initial thrill and interest of the users, a more negative and unpleasant use of the app emerged. Users, under the cloak of anonymity, engaged in all forms of cyberbullying and harassment. Secret moderators stated they weren’t ready to deal with the flood of negative posts and inappropriate behavior.

As cyberbullying stories increased, so did the media news that covered such stories. A court ruling in Brazil even banned Secret from the country deeming it unconstitutional since although free speech was allowed, free speech (and the harassments that said speech could contain) should not be anonymous.

The app lost traction and was eventually suspended."
PepperTap,Large and fast grocery delivery service,Food & Beverage,India,2014,2016,Shut Down,Poor Product,2,"Milind Sharma, Navneet Singh","1,000-5,000",4,$51.2M,7,"PepperTap provided online shopping platform that addressed customers' need to buy groceries from local markets by delivering the goods to their doorsteps. It targets buyers from different groups of cities, divided into three tiers. The service helps in solving the problems of long queues in the market, limited parking spaces and manipulative intermediaries. Grofers, their main competitor, focused only on big cities to reduce management costs. Another strong competitor of theirs is BigBasket which manages its own inventory and operates as a mega wholesaler, while PepperTap obtains their inventory from local suppliers.","Among the reasons why the company shut down even after receiving big investment money from investors, was the deep-seated perception in customers' minds that online platforms should provide cheaper solutions to their needs. To accommodate such expectations, PepperTap offered discounts and sales which were disproportionate to their account strength. PT also failed to weigh the scalability of their project before its full-blast expansion, which caused problems related to technology. For example, certain segments of their products malfunctioned and could not be accessed by customers on the platform.

PepperTap entered the online grocery business without sufficient preparation. It failed to acknowledge the need for deep pockets, large assortment, competitive prices and inventory management.

While 2015 was a great year for startups, and PepperTap was able to find venture capitalists relatively easily, 2016 brought a different scenario. Startups all over the world faced a slowdown in VC activities, and PepperTap had to bow down to the situation. The costs that the company had to bear were high compared to the profit it made. Since they operated without their own inventory, they needed to pay for outsourcing of inventory management plus technology, operation, etc.

PT founders also pointed out that the fact the Indian market was still unprepared for this type of service factored in as a reason that caused them to suspend their operations. The delivery fee for home delivery was seen as too high, particularly in second and third tiers cities or areas where the presence of delivery boys (kirana), was common and proved to be a tough competition to the online platform strategy.

Grocery shopping is also a favorite leisure activity after work among Indians and is often seen as an activity that brings the family together, making it an additional cultural challenge to Internet grocery businesses in India.

The site offered heavily discounted invite only flash sales to its customers and gained huge popularity and rave reviews in its first operational months. Most products were initially from little-known brands and included prenatal care products, baby gear, travel accessories, bedding and bath, children's clothing, toys, DVDs, and educational materials. The site also promised to be an eco-friendly site that would plant a tree for each new purchase on the site in the name of the buyer’s child.","The main culprit for the downfall of the popularity of Zulily is poor marketing and user-attention strategies. Most notably, in order to access the search engine and databases of Zulily’s shopping items, the platform required new visitors to give their email addresses prior to even seeing what the online store had to offer. This marketing trick met with a lot of criticism because it violated some basic marketing principles. Zulily initially achieved record success with the number of new subscribers who registered on the site, but the Zulily team soon noticed that sales began rapidly to decline. People gave their mail only to peek at the site and registered users couldn’t necessarily be considered loyal or even willing customers. Zulily's inadequate marketing strategy and front-page email requests discouraged thousands of potential new customers to sign up, while their existing users often bought only once or anyway not enough to sustain the financial stability of the company. Users also stated that they felt overwhelmed by the number of merchandise and flash sales invitations the e-shop offered so the company complied by diminishing them, and a decrease in revenue also followed.

Moreover, although Zulily sometimes offered brand names for ridiculously small prices, there would often be longer than expected delivery times to customers which also earned them poor reviews."
EventVue,Built online communities for conferences,Finances,United States,2007,2010,Shut Down,Lack of PMF,2,"Josh Fraser, Rob Johnson",10-Jan,2,$455K,9,EventVue was as a social private network whose aim was to assist online communities to have a better conference networking experience. This platform helped attendees connect from different parts even before they met at the conference. The platform sought to make social connections easier for people who frequently traveled to attend conferences around the world but end up not knowing or not interacting with their fellow attendees before and after they got to the event. The startup later pivoted to become an event discovery platform.,"EventVue shutdown in February 2010, due to the fact that it lacked product-market fit and failed to test early on their assumptions about the usefulness of the product from their target customers view.

EventVue co-founder Josh Fraser wrote in a postmortem that EventVue was a Vitamin instead of a painkiller, the platform was ‘nice to have’ but not necessarily needed by conference organizers. Despite the fact that organizers thought it was a good platform for connectivity and interaction, they weren’t particularly interested in paying for it since it didn’t bring them any additional revenue, cut any of their expenses or make their business any better. Being able to sell more tickets was the primary focus of conference organizers and their product wasn’t addressing that need.

Discovering this, EventVue decided to take a different approach by introducing the EventVue Discover widget which automatically notified people about who else would be attending the conference in hope that this would increase ticket sales for the event. However, this feature backfired at them and sales actually dropped. It seemed that most attendees used the widget to check if friends and acquaintances would attend and when they learned that no one they knew didn’t sign up they refrained from purchasing conference tickets."

They stored and sold the same fashion accessories and apparel which official stores were unable to sell for the regular price.
","Ever-changing circumstances were involved for the most part in the collapse of this online retailer of high-quality and branded apparel that had a luminous moment in unstable financial times.

In order to cope with the recession and maintain their position above the margin, manufacturers started to sell their stored products at heavily discounted prices. This provided online flash sell companies with the perfect momentum to rise and thrive. Once the economy started improving, though, and customers regained their purchasing power, flash sales marketplaces started seeing a steady decrease in sales. At the same time, luxury brands rapidly recovered from the previous economic crisis and continued once again to produce their high-end product. Manufacturers decided to not let their high-end brands sell for bargain prices anymore and abandoned the idea of participating in flash sales in order to maintain their reputation and stable income. This meant that flash sales lost their core attractiveness and became generally obsolete. The momentum ended and so did the future of the company.

It also offered uptime and performance analytics, monitoring site health and reporting services through SMS, email or phone. The website monitoring was enabled on the client’s blog or site and started checking and reporting problems should they arise. Their notifications were not an “add-on-service” but were part of the core product offering.","The main problem for Verelo was inadequate funding and traction that was required to push the company to the next stage.

Gowalla,Social Guide to world's cities,Social Media,United States,2007,2013,Acquired,Competition,2,"Josh Williams, Scott Raymond",Oct-50,3,$10.4M,11,"Gowalla was a location-based social platform website and app that allowed users to check-in and share with others their location. It was launched in 2007 and had as a major competitor Foursquare, also a location-based app. The latter, however, has had way more success and currently boasts a user base of 45 million people while Gowalla shut down in 2012 as it reached 600,000 users.

Gowalla’s main feature was the check-in option for its users when they were close to certain “Spots”. The platform also gamified and encouraged users to actively share their location. Users could achieve a higher role and gain access to certain features if they demonstrated a high level of engagement with the app and sometimes received “items” that were provided by partner companies as promotional tools.","When the Gowalla team realized that their competitors in the check-in service were far ahead of them, it reinvents itself and tried to come up with a different design which was to support the newfound focus as a traveling and storytelling platform.

The main problem with Gowalla seemed to be that it tried to do and be too many things at once, whereas Foursquare, for one, focused on one or two basic services that users would infallibly go back to.

Gowalla had a better design and was aesthetically more pleasing, and yet FSQ, which launched in the densely populated New York, saw a rapid growth because users recommend it to their friends for the check-in and rewards features it offered and received social validation for using it, since ‘everyone’ was using it.

Funding was also probably not the main problem for the startup as Gowalla raised 3M in investments and partnered with giants such as Disney, National Geographic, and several major U.S. Universities.

Gowalla’s team joined Facebook in December 2011. Facebook claimed that it acquired the app but that it wouldn’t make use of the user data that it had generated over the years. FB representatives stated that they were rather more interested in partnering with the developers that brought forward the startup since they shared similar values and vision and could help enhance certain aspects of FB’s platform.

First, Chae admitted that the company had set for itself unrealistic goals, which were hard to strategize and they achieve most of them. Their product was unreliable and they were not able to quickly expand also due to how the landscape of Facebook marketing changed. Many technical issues like bugs and periods of downtime affected the quality of their service and they were not able to get rid of them since they also had to keep up with the frequent changes on the FB platform.

Most importantly, FB itself rolled out in that period its own Insights service which any Page owner could use for free to learn about their audience, receive detailed statistics and receive optimization suggestions.

The actual Wesabe web application also integrated community forums which include a dozen other people who are devoted to making smarter and better financial decisions.,"The tragic downfall of Wesabe can be ascribed to two major reasons.

To understand the first one, we need to talk about Yodlee. Yodlee is a company that offers an automatic data aggregation system for PFMs. This was usually done by screen-scraping the client’s bank account website activity on the supported bank corporations by Wesabe. This information is then transferred to the PFM's own platform for them to analyze. On a meeting with Wesabe, both parties never agreed to close the deal since Wesabe referred to Yodlee as a “crumbling corporation” and was afraid they wouldn’t be able to follow through. Because of these instances, Wesabe opted for a different solution. Instead of working with Yodlee, Wesabe chose to make their own data acquisition program which was to supposedly have better privacy settings for clients. This move, however, later resulted in Wesabe losing to Mint - their main competitor- since Wesabe’s data acquisition system was never fully finished. Instead, when Mint launched into the market a few months after Wesabe, it had its own data aggregation system, all thanks to its partnership with Yodlee.

Apart from that, there was also the fact that Mint provided a better and easier user experience. Mint’s system automatically categorized and edited the client’s data which resulted in a better consumer experience. While Wesabe’s clients needed to fill out more fields on sign-up forms, which was a little bit of a hassle for most people who often opted for the easier choice even though Wesabe’s platform was more precise and would have helped them make better financial decisions on the long run.

The company seemed to have lost focus multiple times, raising seed investments but never really changing their business model. The company finally suspended its services and filed for bankruptcy although it’s still not clear what exactly caused their finances to get out of control.

The platform saw a rapid growth on its launch: 1 million users in less than two months. It allowed people to anonymously ask questions and send messages to other users without having to sign up.,"As with any other platform that gains its attraction for its anonymous features, Formspring’s users rushed in, but as the user base increased so did the problems that were associated with anonymity. Cyberbullying came to the level that several teen suicides were linked to the bullying that took place on the site.

The startup tried to remedy by collaborating with the MIT Lab to search for a way to discourage cyberbullying. Eventually, the site had to limit the anonymity feature but that meant that it would lose its appeal, users started decreasing and growth simply froze.

If success leaves clues, so does failure. Many platforms that focused solely on anonymous interactions had to pull out the plug because of the predictable type of behavior that people tend to have when they can’t or don’t have to be accountable for their actions,even when those actions directly endangered the psychological or physical well-being of another human being."

It provided its customer with complimentary maple sugar cookie in every order made. Unlike others companies, maple gave full restaurant experience for it had its own apps, delivery staff, and kitchens. The idea was to have top chefs prepare the main menu and have satellite kitchens provide the complementary dishes. Since the business didn’t have to incur in the high expenses that come when opening an actual restaurant, they could afford to provide premium dishes at an affordable price.","Maple’s original plan when they started out in 2015 was to offer customers great food at reasonable prices. However, leaked reports from the company revealed that Maple was losing money on each delivered meal and it only began making a 30 cents profit on meals from 2016. Although they first relied on their investor’s fundings to cover operational costs, the forecasted losses were too high and they wouldn't be able to sustain it. So, they increased the price, added delivery fees, and changed ways of computing sales tax. These sudden price increases led many customers to shift to other providers that offered the same or better services for less money.

Maple also spent a lot to buy expensive grass-fed beef, antibiotic-free chicken, and also imported pricey oils. Some sources claim that Maple lacked the operational chops to prepare and deliver meals on scale while maintaining quality and producing a profit. Maple kitchens were also not well equipped to cook 10,000 meals a day.

Furthermore, when Maple launched they used to give a complimentary maple sugar cookie, afterward they withdrew them saying that they were moving away from all kinds of non-natural products to good simple food. This might have ulteriorly displeased customers that became accustomed to the signature free of charge cookie after each order.

Hungry customers could find and order their perfect meal within seconds of opening the app, according to the startup founders. Dazo (formerly TapCibo) achieved this by analyzing and saving users’ behavior, preferences and direct feedback. The startup counter-intuitive approach of only working with about 20 restaurants that offered different cuisines was based on the (true) assumption that hungry customers had no patience for going through dozens of restaurants menus and reviews. What they needed was the best food delivered within minutes for an affordable price, and this is exactly what Dazo was about.","Two of the main reasons the company decided to shut shop were fierce competition and lack of funding.

Heavy capital investment is essential in the food-tech industry and Dazo started running low on funding.

The high competition in the sector led companies to slash their prices until practically no company could make substantial revenue from the sector and the cost of client acquisition actually increased. Needless to say, Dazo struggled to find funds and the company opted for ceasing its operations within a year of their launch."

RethinkDB was built from its inception for real-time web applications. It provided solutions to make processes faster and more reliable such as using live push updates instead of the traditional and slower polling for data in queries.","RethinkDB founder highlighted in a postmortem some of the reasons for which he believed his company failed to thrive despite that fact that they had a good product.

Choosing the ‘wrong market’ was mentioned as one of their major mistakes. Since the beginning they were taken by their clients as being an open-source tool and pretty much no one wanted to pay for it. If a substantial price barrier would have been put, users would have probably searched for another tool in the ocean of free and open-source tools that other developers make available. Another major blunder was that despite they focused on seemingly important metrics, these weren’t the metrics users and clients were primarily interested in. Their ‘metrics of goodness’ according to the startup were releasing a flawless product (and yet their successful competitors at MongoDB became very popular even though they had an initial buggy product), design a simple interface, and database consistency. On the other hand, customers wanted the products to be available as soon as possible (they had to wait almost 3 years for RethinkDB), speedy performance, and a good and tried way to store JSON documents and create reports.

Fortunately, RethinkDB technology won’t fall into oblivion as it has been acquired a couple of months after its 2016 shutdown by the Linux Foundation (CNFC)."

Teforia initially costed over $1000, the company also sold prepackaged leaf packets.","The first reason why Teforia was deemed to fail despite the substantial capital it raised was the absence of market fit for the product. Even if tea enthusiast were so particular about their tea they would have thought twice about spending a $1K on a tea making machine. The problem was also the fact that according to some reviews the tea didn’t taste better than that made in the traditional manner. The accompanying sets of cups were also delicate and high maintenance, which defeated the stated purpose the app of making the tea ritual more convenient and enjoyable. The company claimed that people were not ready nor ‘learned’ enough to appreciate the fine details that made the product so needed.

It is also plausible to think that people became skeptic of smart kitchen products when, during the same period, a similarly high-priced machine that pressed vegetable to make the ‘perfect glass of fresh juice’, the Juicero, was publicly shown to be perfectly useless."

OpTier services included an Application Performance Management (APM) which helped businesses manage and optimize their projects with the help of contextualized large data. OpTier technology provided a way to empower trade arrangements by analyzing billions of business transactions daily and offered insights that aimed at helping companies proactively manage their businesses.,"One of the main reasons that were recognized as having pushed the founders of OpTier to discontinue the application was the little market share, revenue and investment capital to re-position and regain growth. The company had raised over $100M in the seed funding but never kept pace with the market changes.

OpTier was founded when websites were the main center of attention were website-based application and their technology required months in order to provide meaningful transaction monitoring. However new companies were able to provide the same service in a matter of hours and OpTier wasn’t quick enough to adapt to the new market expectations.

Another element that factored in OpTier becoming suddenly obsolete was the launch of the iPhone and the start of the mobile based applications. Mobile phone brought up a system of interaction compared to the later where the focus was on monitoring system performance and APM had to expand to analyze customer trends across multiple channels. OpTier, which had already started having losses, lacked enough capital to implement such profound changes to its technology so as to meet the new customers’ demands."

The official app was never released.,"Crowdmix extravagantly spent £14 millions of their investors’ money long before realizing a working product to the public.

The company spent lavishly on parties, flamboyant decorations for its offices and international travel for its staff. No one had a clear vision of the product, and founders kept adding features even before having a consolidated trial version. Moreover, Crowdmix lacked a clear  HR policy. This led to overstaffing and consequently contributing to the high running costs, with people being hired to ‘raise the company profile’ rather than because they actually provided a service for the company.

The founding CEO was reportedly forced to leave the company, which was left without any other investor willing to back it up and filed for bankruptcy.

Shuddle drivers, which were usually moms, teachers, and nannies, were said to have been hand-selected through the extensive screening process so as to assure kids would have a safe, reliable and on time ride service.","The company offered a much-needed service but parents became increasingly disappointed with it. Online reviews of the company show that the service that claimed to be the safest and most reliable to children, would routinely leave kids stranded, cancel the booking at the last moment or make them wait for long times. Shuddle customer support was also poor and, apparently, often no one would answer or return calls. Although there were parents who routinely used the app and coped with the shortcomings since there was no other similar service in the area, there was still a big chunk of parents that would try the service once and vow to never use it again for how inconvenient it was.

Adding to the service quality, there were also concerns about security since Shuddle did not subject their drivers to fingerprints background checks claiming at one point that they were too expensive for them or that they were not needed.

Their business strategy also seemed faulty. Reports state that the company lost a lot of money on several rides and that they incurred losses on every ride they made before 2016. They charged a $9 per month subscription fee plus the ever-changing fare fees, and yet was said to struggle to pay for its operational costs and employees’ salaries.

Shuddle was unable to raise funds to keep themselves afloat, no one was interested in investing or acquiring them, and they closed down in 2016.

One of SchoolGennie co-founders detailed in a post the factors that caused the death of the company.

The first and most fatal of them was probably not having any experience in the educational sector and not testing their product for market fit. They've also tried to delay the release of the product to ‘perfect it' instead of testing the waters with an MVP, thus increasing production costs and losing time. Spending money on unnecessary office furniture instead of spending it on hiring experienced developers was also on their miss list. When they realized that schools and teachers weren't interested in their product they tried to copy their competitors with little success as they had no expertise in the services they were trying to add, to begin with. Within a few months, the team started losing sight of their initial vision and paid too much heed to outside influences. This caused a divide between the two founders which caused delayed decisions and uncertainty. Again, most of these problems could have been avoided had they had a mentor, which admittedly, they didn't search eagerly enough for."

The platform helped designers all over the world to find their dream projects and companies were happy to be able to choose from a talented pool of designers.,"Design Inc. reached market saturation after some time. The number of projects and companies were not increasing and the startup could not make enough revenue to cover operation costs. This put the company in a low cash situation and they founder took the decision to close it down.

Design Inc. CEO identified a number of reasons that he believed contributed to the failure of his company. He stated that he should have been more focused on the essentials of business, which is getting more leads and profit. He also mentioned that a startup founder should also test his assumptions and keep on optimizing the product in every little way. Team members should also be encouraged to experiment without fear.

Another broader issue that is not exclusively linked to Design Inc. may be with the business model itself since the design field is considered a top-end market where job posts are scarce by nature. Too many designers compete for only a limited number of design jobs, thus causing the market to saturate too soon. Another reason why the company might have not witnessed a growth in its network could have been due to the fact that although designers are introduced to the clients by Design Inc. platform, in the end, they might decide to continue their business transactions independently from the marketplace."

Through Sunrise, users could access calendars from their Gmail, iCloud and Microsoft Exchange all with the goal to simplify the use of calendars and the event planning process.","Sunrise had good reviews from users, the problem is that calendars are very hard to monetize and they have a very low entry barrier. Sunrise differentiated itself in that it worked as a native app and could integrate seamlessly with other applications, and yet it’s challenging to have a large customer base when there are plenty of products that do the same job for free.

So, the company shut down because of two main reasons: difficulty in finding new customers and the ability to profit from the customers. Although the sunrise app offered certain attractive features like its linkage to Microsoft Outlook, the future of calendars has never looked more than the past.

Dinnr did not provide readymade food, it only provided the customer with ingredients and instructions. An exception was made on popular celebrations like Valentine’s Day, Christmas, and Thanksgiving, where they actually offered special ready to eat meals.","DinnrDinnr failed because from the beginning there wasn’t a real market need for the business. Besides, if people had markets and superstores close to them (as it is often the case in developed countries), there would be no need for them to order ingredient when they could go themselves and buy what they needed. Dinnr concentrated on providing and delivering ingredient but the reality is that most potential customers would have rather ordered ready-made meals instead of only ingredient which will then have to prepare. And while the product might have been useful in some cases, the demand for the product was low and it resulted in low-profit margin.

The Dinnr team seems to have developed a product that they personally liked without conducting thorough market research first. They conducted few interviews and concentrated on marketing their service rather than inquiring on the challenges the average customer faces with grocery shopping. They overlooked the fact that pitching a product instead of conducting solid market research gives great statistics on paper but will often lead to nothing but disappointment after the product launches.

Moreover, when starting out, Dinnr, set high monthly goals for themselves but they were too ambitious and failure to meet their own expectations might have dealt them an ulterior mental blow."

To make it worse, they hired a wrong team member which affected the company’s productivity as he didn’t complete any task and disappeared for months.

One of the greatest challenges they faced was intense competition from other companies offering similar services. The on-demand market was particularly crowded in the food delivering space, hence they had to compete in an already saturated market where the differentiating factor was poor.

On-demand startups rely on the contact with the consumers and the perception they have of the company, SpoonRocket failed terribly at creating trust and loyalty into their customer base.

Unlike many car portals, Zoomo did not open up their marketplace to other car dealers. Instead, it decided to only list cars after thoroughly inspecting them.The car would then be sold through peer-to-peer transactions. Zoomo’s aim was to offer a reliable and trustworthy platform where customers would be assured of the quality of the cars and that they would be given a fair, standardized price.

In fact, the three Indian founders decided to close shop and return the money to investors when they still had half of the raised capital in the bank. They also seemed to have a great team of talented and committed people.

The problem the venture had was more related to the Indian market itself. The buy-and-sell automobile market was relatively young in India and many of the people that would come to Zoomo’s site would often be first time buyers or sellers who had close to no experience in the car transaction market. Customers, in particular, would often like a certain model but when they checked the price for a similar model on other marketplaces they would discover that it would often be lower, not realizing that there might have been hidden reasons for the slashed price tags. They weren’t able to assign standardized prices to cars based on their conditions, model and features and the haggling was deeply rooted in the Indian culture. So, their estimation was that for every 100 cars they inspected they sold only 20, which would not have been sustainable. They changed their strategy and decided to have a base price for the car and have inspections performed as an added service for an additional cost. The modification allowed to sell slightly more cars but not enough.

Zoomo’s team concluded that the Indian market was not ready and that they needed a more mature environment to be able to pull off a similar model and make it scalable. After considering a merger or an acquisition for a brief period, they decided to cut their journey short and return the rest of the remaining capital."

In other words, there were few of them who maliciously tried to stop the intentions of Shipbeat to reduce the overall logistics costs by re-selling what they initially had to offer.

The other serious problem they had to face, was when Shipbeat tried to expand their logistic services in other market areas. They had difficulties while trying to integrate a new set of carriers into their operations since forming new partnerships was often a heavy and slow process and they had not enough influence or user base to gain the full attention of critical carriers in new regions.

Moreover, from the technological and logistic side, any big or minor change often created an additional hustle for all parties involved, from the carriers to the customers as well as potential warehouses.

After the idea of reaching out to a shipping broker as a possible solution failed, the company declared bankruptcy."
Sidecar,Provided B2B delivery transportation network,Transportation,United States,2011,2015,Acquired,Competition,2,"Jahan Khanna, Sunil Paul",50-100,5,$45.5M,21,"Sidecar was a transportation company based in united states (US). It was founded a couple of years after Uber but was never able to catch up with it despite the fact that it had a good product built on solid technology. One of the features Sidecar introduced was that of enabling riders to set their own price. In general, the app of the company offered much more control over their riding experience both for drivers and riders.","Sidecar had top-notch technology but no marketing strategy. Car-hailing services depend on the traction present in the market and the network of drivers and passengers that they build. Sidecar could only become useful - and profitable - if there was always a high density of drivers and users. This is mainly where Sidecar failed. Unlike their giant competitors (Uber and Lyft) they didn't invest enough to market their product and gain customers. Uber reportedly lost almost a million in its first 6 months while it heavily focused on acquiring customers. Sidecar didn't have the backup funding to do that on a similar scale.

Also, instead of focusing on its powerful technology and the empowerment their app gave to its users, they tried to place themselves as an affordable alternative to Uber, which didn't really work for them. Weeks after shutting down on December 2015, though, they were acquired by GM.

Flud,Social news reader for different platforms,Productivity,United States,2010,2013,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,2,"Bobby Ghoshal, Matthew Ausonio",Oct-50,3,$3.1M,4,"Flud was a social news reader available for iPads, iPhones, Androids and Windows platform. Flud distinguished itself from other news readers because users could save or store articles and news in the reading list for later reading. It was made to display RSS feeds from other blogs or news sites which made it easy for individuals to stream different sources of news - at the same time - on a single platform. Flud was considered as one of the best social news readers because it had a beautiful UI design, users could create profiles, follow other users, create communities and discussions around a topic and become major contributors by sharing their content.","The reason for which Flud joined the graveyard list of failed startups was mainly that they were unable to raise additional funding for their operations. Despite its various ways to raise money (including making it an enterprise), the company failed to become profitable and eventually ran out of cash.

Another reason the company failure could be attributed to was the unreliable volume of demand. The market was already filled with similar products and the competition was too high. When Flud came to be, Flipboard and Pulse were already the leading franchise in the field.

An additional reason why the company didn’t ultimately succeed was the lack of initial testing of the product. Moreover, they had sought the press too early on, without having a thoroughly tested product. The large media coverage the app received did Flud more damage than good because people, upon hearing about the app, would download it and try it out. Flud wasn’t expecting to have so many users download the app, so they suddenly had to deal with glitches and bugs. Having a faulty app when respected companies were praising it, might have cost them a bit of credibility and stopped the momentum they could have had."
CircleBack Lending,A P2P marketplace for online lending,Finances,United States,2012,2016,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,2,Manoj Ramnani & Patrick Questembert,Oct-50,1,$12M,4,"Founded in 2013, Circle Back Lending was launched as an online personal loans marketplace connecting potential borrowers with lenders who could lend them any amount ranging from $1000 payday loans to $35,000 Personal Loans for longer-term reasons (ranging from 36 to 60 months). The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) offered on these loans ranged from 6.63 to 35.82 % (credit cards have an APR between 17-24 %). Circle Back promised a quick inquiry process and a private and secure system that would send cash directly to your account after contact with and approval by a verified and registered lender.","The company saw some success initially and entered into a partnership with Jefferies Group LLC that was to help with the sale and securitization of $500 million in principal amount of consumer loans. The stated goal of this partnership with an established financial services firm was to provide loans to a much wider segment of the US population, which needed a responsible alternative to traditional bank loans and credit cards.

3 years down the line, the company was exposed in an article by Bloomberg that it had stopped giving out loans. This was mainly a result of borrowers failing to pay their loans.

For starters, in 2014, the company had generated a minuscule $4m in total loans (a year into its founding), but that didn’t stop Jefferies Group LLC from agreeing to securitize up to $500m of its loans. This is nothing new in the fin-tech world as shown by the $5 billion dollar deal that was inked in 2017 by industry leader Prosper (founded in 2005). Prosper Inc., which had been one of the pioneers of the P2P Online lending industry, was one of the earliest to turn to Wall Street to securitize its loans by repackaging them as bonds through the likes of Citigroup and others.

Then there has been a problem with the sudden firing of CEO s and top staff that was a regular occurrence at both Prosper, and Lending Club (another pioneer in the P2P lending business). The unexpected departure of Lending Club’s founding CEO put the entire industry in a tailspin as funding dried up.

Despite this, there seem to be much bigger and more fundamental problems that the entire P2P lending industry is ignoring.

1. With the advent of online banking, and the P2P companies relying on their own credit rating (like FICO), the line between banks and P2P lending has become blurred, and they are constantly diverging from the reason that this industry was founded (providing loans to those seen outside the scope of banks).

2. A far bigger problem that exists is the staggering rate at which P2P companies fail at returning capital to investors. A closer look into the P2P lending industry in China reveals some crucial data. The P2P industry fulfilled a growing need in the country, where bank loans were much harder to get by. But by the end of 2015, there were 1,031 total troubled platforms out of 3,448 platforms still in operation, with most of the problems being people that absconded with the cash. Despite much-needed regulation of the industry starting in 2018, the total number of platforms that went bust as of February 2019 were over 5000, with 177 million RMB ($25 million) in unpaid loans.

ChaCha,Search engine with a live human being,Software & Hardware,United States,2005,2016,Shut Down,Competition,2,Brad Bostic & Scott Jones,50-100,9,$96M,9,"ChaCha was a bit of “fresh air” being blown into the search engine industry. Back in 2006 when Facebook was in its infant years and Google had sort of established itself as a frontrunner to being the number one search engine on the Internet, ChaCha arrived seemingly out of nowhere.

In short, what the startup offered was a search engine where you could interact with a live human being - a “guide” of sorts, and then get the guides to manually search for the things that you were looking for on the Internet. So basically you just sat in the comforts of your own home and instead of having to search for things on your own, you could get someone to do it for you. What you did was simply logging on a chat interface and you told the guide what to search for. You could also chat and interact with the guide during the search.","To understand why ChaCha failed it’s important that you understand how search engines functioned back in 2006 and the early 2000’s. Back in the day, you couldn’t just type one single word and the search engine would find every, single relevant result, including results ‘near you’, as Google can nowadays. 

No, you really had to dig deep to find exactly what you were looking for. Search engines weren’t as complex as they are now, and their algorithms certainly didn’t do much of the thinking for you. In many cases, you had to manually search at least 3-4 pages of the search engine before you found a decent result, and even then it wasn’t as tailored to your request as it is nowadays. 

If you needed something specific found on the Internet, you needed a librarian who could quickly scout through a number of articles, websites and publications. A lot of the people who really understood how to find information fast on the Internet had a master’s degree because it was so complex and difficult to scour through the tons of information without any proper algorithm. 

However, ChaCha soon got stiff competition. Google released its Panda algorithm back in 2011 that virtually put it as the de facto information source on the Internet. If you searched for something on Google, you would be lucky to find results from sites like ChaCha, Ask.com, and Answers.com. They all got pushed further down. 

Not only that but at its peak, ChaCha had 55,000 virtual employees. They faced big management problems and there were even some cultural issues they had to take care of as well. The costs of hiring people to manual do research simply became too high, when comparing them with the results you could get from Google. And in addition, it became more difficult for the guides to give proper answers on subjective matters like politics, religion and so on. 

Ultimately, hiring people to manually search and give answers to questions wasn’t a sustainable project when Google offered the same thing, only through a simple online search."
Utrip,AI-powered travel planning services,Travel,United States,2012,2019,Shut Down,Mismanagement of Funds,2,"Gilad Berenstein, Yair Berenstein",Oct-50,4,$6M,13,"Utrip was a travel planning startup that used Artificial Intelligence and user recommendations to create highly personalized itineraries for its clients. Utrip was started on July 15, 2012, by Gilad Berenstein, his engineer-father Yair Berenstein, and Edan Shahar. They managed to raise a corpus of $4 million from some high profile investors that included Acorn Ventures, Tiempo Capital, and some executives from Apple and Costco.

Apart from helping travelers, they also had a white-label product called Utrip PRO which was sold to hotels, travel agencies, and DMOs (Destination Marketing Organizations) that wanted to offer travel planning on their websites. With millions of traveler profiles and data points gathered through its partnerships, it did look like they had cracked personalization for travelers. But unfortunately, it was not the case.","Despite having 80 clients, most of them had limited budgets which made it difficult for Utrip to gain traction and be profitable. The costs associated with sales, marketing and keeping the recommendation engine alive was too much for them since their expenses were higher than their revenue at one point. The investors wanted to see growth and there was no way they could show traction without spending more. They were caught in a vortex they had little control over as only an external push could save them. 

For Utrip to survive, they either had to find investors or be acquired. The founders turned to their biggest clients to see if they would be willing to invest in Utrip. Many of them balked at the idea because they were worried that they would be investing in a product that its competitors would use. 

Another aspect of its failure was that the founder himself admitted that they spent more on their technology and concentrated less on sales and marketing. B2C travel startups have a tough time driving traffic as the biggies like TripAdvisor and Expedia could easily outdo them with their marketing. 

There was also a lot of banter about how the investors were not properly communicated with during the fag end of the company. While there is no way to ascertain that, we can safely say that things weren’t okay between the founders and the investors. Media company Skift says that trip-planning startups have failed more than other companies in the travel space. 

A buyer was interested in Utrip, a 94-page acquisition document was prepared and just three days before the signing, the deal was called off. The lawyers of the buyer unearthed a patent by a rival company called WayBlazer that had a direct conflict with Utrip’s technology. Attempts to buy the patent from the company failed. Seven weeks after this incident, Utrip shut down.

Laurel & Wolf,Online interior design marketplace,e-Commerce,United States,2014,Active,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,2,"Brandon Kleinman, Leura Fine",50-100,4,$25.5M,14,"Launched in 2014 by Laure Fine and Brandon Kleinman, Laurel & Wolf was an online marketplace whose aim was to bring budget-friendly interior design solutions to customers through the Internet. Laurel & Wolf theorized that a  customer would pay a flat consultation fee to be paired up with a  designer over the company’s online platform. Though some small tweaks were made over the model and pricing over the years, its basic premise always revolved around cutting out the middleman to bring quality to the customers, a concept that SF venture funds bet largely on.","Even though Laurel & Wolf generally maintained a positive, marketable image, beginning the summer of 2018, the company’s reviews on sites like Yelp were populated with an influx of mainly one-star rants. Most of the reviewers complained that furniture and other items that they had ordered through the platform either arrived broken or were never delivered. Some clients also complained of having received substandard services and never receiving refunds that they claimed for. As a result of the poor publicity, a majority of Laurel & Wolf’s designers left the platform.

However, dissatisfied customers were not the only cause of Laurel and Wolf’s downfall. The company also had various disgruntled employees that were not happy with how it was being run. Despite this, the company tried to maintain their positive, quirky social image—going as far as having employees at dance classes and bowling excursions showcased on the company’s Instagram account. Behind closed doors, however, the atmosphere did not reflect the company’s joyful facade. For instance, while co-founder Laure Fine presented herself as being generally upbeat in her interviews, most employees recounted their fear of her. On many occasions, she would publicly and bluntly berate anyone that disagreed with her ideas. On top of this, despite being a design-based company, payouts to designers were generally small and were reduced without explanation.

It is hence not too difficult to conclude that Laurel & Wolf’s internal operations were quite chaotic. For a long period, it was running without any dedicated internal accounting, HR, or clear management structure. Moreover, their first office was cramped up and with just one bathroom. When they moved to a new building, it had a range of structural issues, tight packing and has sewage seeping into the ground floor which posed health risks. 

“They have to know they can’t treat people that way.” claimed a worker who quit the company just a few months after joining. “I would get in at about 8:30, and I wasn’t leaving until about 9:00 at night. I thought it was because we were so busy, but actually, the way we did things was just really complicated.” declared another.

Combined with large spendings in marketing and branding, all of these factors led to  Laurel & Wolf’s ultimate downfall. In March of 2019, the company closed its virtual shop and soon after, its website followed."
Navdy,Augmented driving device for cars,Transportation,United States,2013,2018,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,2,"Doug Simpson, Karl Guttag",50-100,4,$41.8M,20,"Navdy wanted to revolutionize automotive navigation through a heads-up display (HUD) model that projected the GPS navigation in front of you (much like in an airplane cockpit). The company's user-friendly device was meant to be installed on the dashboard of a car, right in front of the steering wheel and help make driving much safer by getting people to look straight ahead at the road rather than at their phones. Navdy also came up with its own ios app that linked up with the main HUD device and provided it with the relevant navigational output to display to the driver.

Navdy’s pitch was quite straightforward. Whereas head-up displays are increasingly common in some cars (generally performance or luxury models), they’re still a relative rarity on mainstream vehicles, and there’s usually no retrofitting possible from the automakers themselves. Their solution, therefore, was a device that mounted on the dashboard that included a small, transparent display panel within the driver’s line of sight that would project navigational information right in front of the driver.","Navdy's HUD device was initially priced at $799, but they soon found out that demand was not going to keep pace with such a highly-priced gadget as predicted. The price was soon slashed down to $499 but instead of an influx of new demand, Navdy would learn the hard way that the HUD market was extremely saturated. As previously states, the HUD display market is not something new and is quite common in high-end luxury cars. Navdy planned to create a new market for HUD navigational devices for the average user, but their price did not justify their stated goals.

More importantly, most users were complaining that Navdy’s HUD and its mobile app were not developed to satisfy customer needs appropriately. They argued that the display did not blend into the car’s windshield like some of its high-end competitors’ but that the device rather sat in front of the user’s line of view. This meant that Navdy’s HUD display was in no way a better display compared to looking at a GPS or phone mount that can be purchased for much less. A lot of the customers also felt that the product was very slow in displaying the GPS navigation from its dedicated ios app.

However, more than the product itself, what would really bring down Navdy was their quest to create their own complete navigation system that would substitute Google Maps or other such service providers. The costs for maintaining this service were not as cheap as they probably thought, and the price of maintaining such an expensive venture coupled with a lack of substantial demand for their product would prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Navdy. The company eventually went bust in 2018 due to these shortcomings.

It would then choose and present the one that most closely matched the user's specifications.","Desti wasn’t a faulty app on its own, nor were its services obsolete. The problem seemed to be that although users found the application to be useful and appreciated its location suggestions, they ultimately ended up doing the booking from other more trusted platforms or known brands.

There was also the fact that Desti was a newcomer in a sector which had already several giants such as TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet competing against themselves and to which users automatically resorted to.

Also, Tutorspree's vision of pairing up tutors and students to meet up in person so as to create and maintain a real connection is commendable but not practical. Although indeed, in-person lessons are still very much valuable, the market -and the world- is heading on to a different direction.

It is also possible that the platform,which was initially taking 50% of the tutor’s fees, might have witnessed a decline in overall user growth because nothing could prevent tutors and students to schedule lessons without recurring to Tutorspree after they got to know each other.

Yik Yak enjoyed a lot of popularity especially in schools and college campuses throughout the US in 2013 and 2014. It became the 9th most downloaded social media app in the United States shortly after its launch in 2013 and reached 1.8 million downloads in September 2014.

The app was created by Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington who were college students at the time. The company they founded was initially funded by Atlanta Ventures and secured $1.5 million by other various investors. Once the app grew in popularity after its release, they were able to raise additional rounds of $10 million by the same investors and eventually $60 million by Sequoia Capital. At its peak, the business was valued between $350 and $400 million.

Yet, two years later Yik Yak was no more. On the 28th of April 2017, the company announced that it would be closing down in the coming week.","Yik Yak’s Fall in Popularity
The technical reason Yik Yak shut down is quite straightforward. In 2016 Yik Yak shrunk 75% compared to 2015. It was never a self-sustaining business, and when their popularity started decreasing rapidly there was no reason for their investors to continue to fund the project. The company laid off 60% of its workforce and was eventually forced to shut down. It sold its intellectual property to Square for $1 million, equal to 0.25% of its peak valuation.

The interesting question is why Yik Yak shrunk in popularity so rapidly after it had shown an obvious product-market fit.

‍

Yik Yak’s Cyberbullying Problem
Cyberbullying proved to be an insurmountable problem for Yik Yak and it played a major role in the apps decline.

Just a few examples to paint a picture:

In 2014, a school in Massachusetts was forced to evacuate its students twice after receiving bomb threats on the app.
Two other schools were forced to evacuate under threats of violence on the app.
Matthew Mullen was arrested by the police in Michigan because of Yaks (posts) he had made threatening a school shooting.
Campus police at the University of Missouri arrested Hunter M. Park because of threats of violence against black students he published on the app. He pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat which resulted in a three-year suspended sentence combined with five years probation.
A student from Virginia Tech pleaded guilty of posting a threat on Yik Yak to repeat the 2007 campus shooting which took 32 lives.
These kinds of egregious offenses were more notable on Yik Yak compared to other social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook because of Yik Yak’s (presumed) anonymity. After all, you wouldn’t want to threaten a shooting with your name in plain sight.

That said, such heavy-duty offenses were somewhat rare nonetheless and you could argue that they would have taken place with or without the app. The real problem was the everyday bullying that took place on Yik Yak because it affected practically all of its users.

Jordan Seman, who had been repeatedly bullied on Yik Yak for her weight, posted an open letter about her problems:

“… when I scrolled through the message board and saw: “If I could bang a hippo for no finals, I would hunt down Jordan Seman.”
‍
My heart was pounding as I looked around the dining hall. A million things crossed my mind: Is someone watching me? Should I have worn this dress? Did someone see me eat that second cookie? Should I put on my jacket?
‍
In that moment, all of my insecurities flooded me. I felt exposed, betrayed and mostly embarrassed.”
Cases like hers lead to a vocal out-cry in the media and several colleges and schools banning the app on their grounds. Two feminist groups and a few former students even filed a federal complaint form against the University of Mary Washington in Virginia for failing to protect them from cyber-harassment and threats of sexual violence on the app.

The story isn’t black and white, however. Some people claimed Yik Yak plaid a positive role on campuses and others argued that the media reaction about the cyberbullying taking place on the app was very overblown. A study at MIT Media Lab compared it to Twitter and found that Yik Yak was less than 1% more likely to contain vulgar content.

All of that said, the hyper-localization of the app made cyberbullying on Yik Yak much more problematic compared to other social media platforms. If someone was bullying you on the app, you would know that they are near you in the real world. This means that even if the cyberbullying wasn’t more prevalent, it felt much more intense and threatening.

Jordan’s thought “Is someone watching me?” when she read the Yak on campus wouldn’t have occurred if the message was on a non-localized platform like Twitter.

Consequently, the media outcry and outright bans aren’t that surprising.

‍

Digital fences: Yik Yak killing its own business
In response to the pressure from the media and various schools and colleges, Yik Yak implemented geo-fencing. It disabled its users from using the app while on the territory of most middle and high schools in the US.

This reaction, however, was suicidal for the business, because the app simply killed half of its biggest use-case. Anonymity and localization meant that the app was most useful for school and college students:

People who are concentrated in one place in large numbers
Belong to the same institution and have many things in common
Might want to remain anonymous when stating an opinion in public
With this in mind, it’s extremely predictable that the app would decline in popularity after it directly killed its biggest market. Moreover, negative growth is fatal for a money-burning venture-funded social media depending on virility.

In hindsight, Yik Yak geo-fencing schools to deal with its cyberbullying problems is equivalent to a person shooting himself in the stomach to deal with his intense stomach-ache.

‍

Failing to manage toxicity through moderation
Yik Yak’s problems aren’t foreign to all other social media platforms. Cyberbullying is, sadly, a common theme on the internet. The common way to deal with it is automatic or even better – manual moderation. For example, Reddit has volunteer moderators on most communities on the site (subreddits) that make sure hate-speech and bullying don’t take place within said communities. Facebook, on the other hand, has paid moderators going through all content flagged by users as inappropriate.

Yik Yak did try to implement some form of automatic self-moderation. A user posing sensitive content would receive the message:

“Pump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it’s probably nothing and you’re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?”

Yet, their efforts were obviously insufficient. A solution similar to that of Reddit might have done wonders for them. Moderation presents problems of its own – it risks becoming over-sensitive, removing any kind of controversial content even when it’s not damaging. That said, it’s far better than the alternative, especially bearing in mind Yik Yak was heavily affected by the cyberbullying problem because of their hyper-localization and young user base.

Rdio developers wanted to offer a product that was beautiful, flawless and social. One of the interesting features of that app was that it would show you what your friends were listening to and would give you music recommendations based on your circle of friends’ playlists.","Although Rdio developed an excellent product, its weakness was in the close to non-existent marketing and distribution department. The fact that they reached the market before Spotify, didn’t help them as the little momentum they initially had was completely lost once Spotify appeared on the scene.

For one, Spotify had an impressive marketing strategy and a business model that made it easier for them to gain more subscribers. While Rdio required users to become paying customers to listen to their streaming service, Spotify broke that entry barrier and offered free music thanks to the paid advertising it incorporated into its product.

Rdio tried a couple of pivoting strategies but these came too late and Spotify had already gained 75 million users (they surpassed 140 million in 2017, 50 million of which were paying subscribers). A mix of bad timing, reluctant leadership, and wrong priorities was what finally caused Rdio to go out of business."

The Gateway is an android application that operates by connecting the user’s network service provider to the internet.","In 2014, 37Coins announced that they were no longer going to support such transactions. The company’s effort to provide Bitcoin transfer technologies across different regions has proved to be nearly impossible for the company. These are the two main reasons for the company’s shutdown:

37Coins stated that delivering monetary funds across different carriers outside of the USA was “Unreliable.”

Furthermore, 37Coins said that their “initial objective was not possible to achieve with the amount of capital raised.” The startup stopped its operations mainly because of lack of sufficient funds. The mere maintenance of the servers that they had developed required a big chunk of capital investment itself, not to mention that the company had several of these server’s set-up all over the globe."

The ideal future Wattage envisioned was that of a world in which anyone could customize their electronics without needing to have any in-depth knowledge in the field. Anyone with an internet connection could start creating and customizing hardware by making use of the startup software. Once the user had all the specifications ready the product would be created with 3D printing, packed and shipped to the customer.","Wattage founder Jeremy Bell shared in a Medium post some of the reason he thinks the startup failed.

Among the first reasons he listed was the fact that they failed to gain traction and validate the existence of market interest for the product. In the early phase of development, their main focus was on demonstrating that the idea could technically be carried out and it was taken for granted that people would see it as a needed solution. Without any proof that people would actually adopt the service, it was difficult to convince investors to fund the project.  All sorts of doubts about viability and scalability started popping up and the team couldn’t provide definitive - or convincing enough - answers.

Wattage was on many points too much ahead of its time, and the full potential of their idea might have been overlooked by prospect investors and the target market. However, in a few years, as technological advances will render customization easier, Wattage (or another company) might re-introduce the concept and carry it out in a successful manner.

Circa,Mobile news app on diverse topics,Entertainment,United States,2011,2015,Acquired,Lack of Funds,3,"Arsenio Santos, Ben Huh, Matt Galligan",Oct-50,8,$4.7M,39,"Circa was a promising startup in the news sector that had the ambitious mission of ‘fixing’ what was wrong with journalism. More specifically, the product this San Francisco based company came up with was a news app that pushed notifications to the user’s phone and delivered digestible bit-sized news specifically for mobiles, at a time at which no news company had yet tried the model. The company offered ‘atomized’ news rather than a summary, which means they broke down the news to its core elements; stats, facts, media, and quotes. Links to different sources were also given so that users could read the full story. Users had also the option of following up on a story and receive updates for specific news.","Circa seems to have gone out of business because they suffered a financial breakdown. In an article titled “Farewell to Circa News” the company stated that producing high-quality news proved to be a costly endeavor and without the capital necessary to support further production they were unable to continue. The company found out that building a revenue stream would take time and only by having enough venture capital they would be able to sustain their operations.

Although their concept was new and innovative, it was quickly copied by giants in the news sector. Circa was unlikely to be able to compete with renowned prints staff nor with their advertising outreach.

Circa was deemed to fail exactly because of the model and strategy it had chosen. Since news were only digests of news they had no strong emotional pull. Users didn’t spend much time on Circa, even after they briefly opened the app, they would go back to the other social and engaging applications that could offer them not only near real-time news but also social interactions.

The company considered monetizing their site by introducing advertisements or charging a subscription for its product but they felt that these minor solutions wouldn’t have made a difference nor provide a high-quality experience to their users, so they decided against it."
Vine,Platform to share short looping video clips,Social Media,United States,2012,2017,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,3,"Colin Kroll, Dom Hofmann, Rus Yusupov",50-100,1,No Data,2,"Vine used to be a video hosting social media website which allowed users to create and share 6-second videos. A bit like TikTok (more on that below).

To put the concept in context, you could say that Vine tried to do to YouTube vlogs the same thing that Twitter did to traditional blogs. Twitter advertises itself as a microblogging social media platform because of its character length restrictions and social features (follows, retweets, etc.). Similarly, Vine was a microvlogging platform because of its video length restriction combined with similar social features.

Consequently, it makes a lot of sense that Vine was acquired by Twitter for $30 million before the app even launched. It presented Twitter with a convenient opportunity to compete with the (considerably bigger) social media giants like Facebook and Google on Video content.

Obviously, not everything went according to plan. Despite being innovative and very culturally influential, Vine became a part of tech, startup, and cultural history. Below, we’ll explore why.","The short answer is: because it was an unprofitable business losing popularity to other similar services, most notably Instagram. Burning money while losing market share simply isn’t sustainable.

The long answer, of course, includes multiple reasons. Why was Vine unprofitable? Why did it start losing popularity despite having the first-mover’s advantage?

Here are the 6 biggest reasons behind Vine’s failure:

‍

1. Vine’s failure to meet market needs:
Vine was initially envisioned as a microvlogging social media platform. People sharing short video clips to their own social circle.

What it became after launch, however, was something quite different - an entertainment media platform. Most of its users were passive viewers consuming the content of a minority of active content creators. More like YouTube, less like Twitter/Facebook/Instagram.

Vine’s whole ecosystem was built on top of the work of the popular content creators, and if they left for any reason the ecosystem would crumble. In that sense, the key to Vine’s success was to make sure it met the needs of its active content creators perfectly in order to keep them engaged on the platform. Vine failed to do that on two key occasions:

First, it stuck to its strict 6-second length for far too long, making it impossible for its content creators to experiment with new types of short-form video content. For example - actual vlogging. You can’t share your opinion on a subject in 6 seconds, but you might be able to do so in a minute.

Second, active content creators spend a lot of time creating content. One of their primary need is a good way to get paid for their efforts, otherwise it simply doesn’t make sense to continue creating high-effort content.

Vine was a good tool to grow an audience, but it was a terrible tool to monetize it. So, it made a lot of sense that once a Viner was big enough, they’d try pushing their audience to other platforms where they’d be able to get paid.

‍

2. Vine’s monetization problems:
The monetization problem was not restricted to the content creators, however – the actual business wasn’t making any money either. Vine was reluctant to experiment with monetization solutions, which is not that uncommon in hyper-growth network-effect startups. This meant, however, that when the growth was gone there was no reason left to keep the service alive.

For example, the money flowing into Vine’s ecosystem was mostly direct sponsorships for the top content creators. Yet, Vine never attempted to include sponsorship solutions into the platform. Twitter bought a social media talent agency to try to monetize indirectly, but this wasn’t a good solution to Vine’s problems. The agency couldn’t incentivize its clients to stay on Vine instead of moving to other competitors, while a good monetization system could’ve been able to.

‍

3. Vine’s competition problems:
Competitors with existing audiences, deep pockets and a good opportunity to move into Vine’s market quickly did so. Short-form video is nowadays a standard feature of a lot of the most popular apps (Instagram, Snapchat, even stories on Facebook, YouTube, etc.).

The first and biggest devastating blow came from Instagram’s 15-sec video feature.

""Instagram video was the beginning of the end"" - quote from a former Vine executive from an interview with The Verge.

Naturally, when you prove the existence of a market and simultaneously fail to meet its needs, you can be sure someone else will do so in your place.

‍

4. Vine’s parent company problems:
One of Twitter’s reasons to acquire Vine at such an early stage was their strategic intention to use Vine to grow Twitter’s own brand and business. This means that Vine as a standalone brand and product wasn’t the top priority of its shareholders.

This is most obvious from the fact that Twitter came out with its own video feature, which pretty much invalidated the need for Vine’s existence. Not surprisingly, Twitter executives were talking about integrating all of Twitter’s video solutions.

Why was Instagram successful under Facebook, while Vine failed under Twitter? I suspect the fact that Instagram was acquired at a later stage of the life of the business plays an important role. Keep in mind Facebook has had trouble popularizing consumer-facing apps that it was.

‍

5. Vine’s executive churn, lack of direction, and leadership problems:
It’s an absolute certainty that Vine’s troubles with Twitter created a lot of problems for the business in subtle ways, less visible to outsiders. Whatever those problems were, however, it’s a fact that Vine had trouble keeping its key executives. Two of the founders left in 2014 (theoretically Vine’s best year!), and the third was laid-off later on, which at least hints at a conflict with the higher-ups in Twitter.

“Vine didn’t ship anything of consequence for a year.” - Ankur Thakkar, in an interview for The Verge

When there is trouble at the top, the problems inevitably trickle down to the whole team. It’s difficult to have good leadership and a strong sense of direction and purpose in such circumstances."
Dinner Lab,Membership-based social dining experiment,Food & Beverage,United States,2011,2016,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,3,"Brian Bordainick, Francisco Robert, Zach Kupperman",Oct-50,2,$9.1M,5,"Dinner Lab had an intriguing approach to the on-demand food market. What Dinner Lab offered was a culinary experience that would take diners away from the traditional dining experience and let them share new dishes with a group of strangers in unusual places. People could sign up for a membership plan and would receive an invitation, ideally 2 to 4 times a month, to take part of a unique experience enriched by exotic food and new people.","The first problem Dinner Lab encountered had to do with the timing at which they offered the meals. Originally, the event would take place at midnight, but pretty soon the company team discovered people at 12:00 am of a weekend tended to be drunk and were both unreliable customers and not really enhancing the experience of the other participants. So, although the idea sounded adventurous and fun, it was impractical and people aren’t used to dine at midnight.

According to Dinner Lab CEO, the company was very challenging to manage as there always was a multitude of variables they had to keep up with, from the food served and its ingredients, to the location, diners registration and turnaround and the staff kept on changing.

Although most customers enjoyed the experience, people complained that there were never enough tickets and never enough events going on. In some cities, people who signed up for a membership which would include at least 2 events per month, ended up having only 1 event every 6 weeks while still having to pay a full subscription.

Dinner Lab blamed the difficulty of having more events on the dwindling running capital. They decided to hire contract workers instead of full-timers with the hope that would decrease the cost. Dinner Lab also tried to sell diners’ surveys to restaurants but without success. They finally found the model unsustainable and closed in 2016 after 5 years of operations."
Lumos,Internet of things startup on switching technology,Software & Hardware,India,2014,2015,Shut Down,Lack of Experience,3,"Pritesh Sankhe, Tarkeshwar Singh, Yash Kotak",10-Jan,1,No Data,1,Lumos was an Internet of Things startup that sought to provide customers with the ultimate smart switching technology. The first-time entrepreneurs who came with Lumos wanted to create internet-connected devices that used machine learning and could adjust and personalize home appliances settings based on the behavior and routines of the user.,"Lumos had to shut down in less than a year and the founders recognized that they “were not the right team to build a hardware company”. The founders admitted at least seven major problems that lead to the downfall of the company.

First of all, they were working in a sector in which they had no expertise in. They’ve also overestimated the utility value of the product and somehow disregarded the fact that the product needed to be sold about five times higher than the production costs to be profitable. Instead, they had designed a product that would not have been by any means cost-effective.

Lumos had no customer persona it could target its marketing to and the startup ended up trying to sell the product both as an energy saving device and a luxury utility. The founders tried to make Lumos make too many things too soon driven by the illusion that often blinds inexperienced entrepreneurs that they were smarter than the rest of the lot and could beat their competitors easily. And to top it all, there was a lack of communication and transparency between the startup team towards the late part of their venture. They started to keep their doubts to themselves instead of working on solving them.

Most of the reasons that caused Lumos failure could have been avoided had the founders sought the counselor mentorship of an experienced entrepreneur or business analyst early on. But then again, maybe they were supposed to learn each of the lessons that the journey presented them with on their own skin to be prepared for the launch of their next startup."
Sip,Daily tappable tech news and stories,Productivity,United States,2018,2019,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,3,"Ryan Hoover, Nick Abouzeid, Chad Whitaker",10-Jan,0,Nothing,0,"Recently, Product Hunt shut down Sip, their project that covered breaking news in the tech industry in a bite-size, tap-to-go-next format similar to that of Instagram, Snap, Facebook, and WhatsApp stories. Although Sip slowly built up a large userbase of over 100k unique monthly users, Ryan Hoover and Product Hunt quietly discontinued the app in early 2019 and new stories immediately stopped populating the app—read on to find out why.","In essence, Sip entered the ""tech news"" field at an awkward time. They had to compete for attention against early-morning email newsletters, constantly-updated Twitter and Facebook feeds, and other channels to essentially be relevant and because their strategy was releasing silent daily notifications at 5 pm, this effort was much more difficult. It would be redundant to read news as it broke on Twitter, for example, and then get another report on it on Sip—people wouldn't be inclined to check a news app for things they've already classified as old.

On top of this, Sip's newsletters tapped into the ever-shortening attention span and inclination to quickly-digestible content by condensing long articles down into single sentences to describe the public release and context behind a new product, funding round, etc. Although truly ambitious, I believe that this posed a difficulty as well in that generally, with news reports in the tech industry, I like to read longer articles that go into depth about previous funding rounds, startups doing similar things, etc. and having a model that relies deeply on being able to digest tech news quickly goes against this form of longer reads.

Finally, Sip made a major mistake in the growth hacking of their userbase. Detailed by Ryan Hoover in his post-mortem of Sip, the team utilized Product Hunt's traffic and platform to drive users to them—essentially ""cannibalizing"" on their own traffic. Generating, managing, and retaining traffic on both platforms proved to be too difficult to continue and soon, Sip quietly shut down. It was an ambitious project that entered a deep pool of big fish armed with a fresh take on content delivery, but went too fast for its own good and eventually sunk to the bottom."
Call9,On-demand doctors in emergency situations,Health,United States,2015,2019,Shut Down,Bad Business Model,3,"Celina Tenev, Timothy Peck, XiaoSong Mu",100-250,3,$34M,10,"Instead of having to call 911 and wait for hours in a nursing room, not knowing if you were going to die or not, Call9 offered a different option. Call9 was especially targeted to patients in the home care industry who needed the urge to speak with a doctor right away about their issues.

The solution was simple. Instead of calling, each patient would be given some medical equipment and an iPad. Using the iPad, the patients could call in to their doctor and get medical advice - in their own living room instead of having to call an ambulance or even drive somewhere by themselves.","One of the core values of the company was to operate on a so-called “value cared basis”. What that meant was that doctors wouldn’t necessarily get paid a flat fee per hour or per consultation, but rather according to how the patient felt after they’d been treated.

So, if the patient felt that the doctor didn’t help them at all, they could justify paying less money or nothing at all. Naturally, this became a problem when dealing with employees who were demanding their money. And also, the USA adopted very slowly to dealing with this kind of relationship between doctors and patients. 

But there might have been other factors involved, too. Call9 had inked deals with Lyft for patient transportation and were planning to expand to Albany, NY, from their base located in Brooklyn. Not only that, but they also operated a community paramedicine division by using their emergency doctor network.

In other words, they had a big vision, and they were expanding their business. But they might have expanded a little too fast with too much money. And that is because, shortly before they shut down their operations, it was learned that the company was entering a bit of a ‘stealth mode’. That was likely because they were still in their early stages as a healthcare startup and struggled with their financial situation.

Call9 acquired some partnerships with various companies in the healthcare industry, and the idea was to make a turn and focus on technology in nursing homes. Ultimately, this plan failed and the company just didn’t have what it took to make it in the tough and cruel world of health tech startups.

One last point is that investors nowadays have less patience than what they did - they want to get back the money they invested rather quick. Things aren’t like they used to be in the early 2000’s where you’d make headlines by getting a 5 Million Dollar round from well-known investors and you’d get invited to conferences and VIP cocktail parties. Now, investors expect results fast. And if you can’t deliver, you won’t survive.

Koinex,Cryptocurrency exchange platform,Finances,India,2017,2019,Shut Down,Legal Challenges,3,"Aditya Naik, Rahul Raj, Rakesh Yadav",50-100,2,-,3,"Koinex started in India in the summer of 2017 and quickly built a big cryptocurrency exchange, reaching a peak in December 2017. During that time, the platform recorded a staggering 246 Million dollars in trading volume and added as much as 45,000 new users during a timespan of only 24 hours! 

The idea was to bring the world of cryptocurrencies to India. The platform let users trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and many other well-known cryptocurrencies on a peer to peer basis.

Users could enjoy the benefits of transparent pricing for each currency so that buyers could place bids and sellers could place ‘asks’. Koinex also offered a highly secure wallet where users could store their money.

Koinex also had raised a secretly kept amount of funding from foreign investors.","On April 6th, 2018, the Reserve Bank of India issued a statement where it said that all government-regulated exchange platforms had to stop trading with and exit relationships with any individual or organization that dealt with cryptocurrency transactions and block such transactions from taking place.

Koinex took the case to court and, to this very day, has a writ pending in the Supreme Court of India, but things move slow and there hasn’t been any progress in the case so far.

The statement meant that all banks in India were forbidden to deal with cryptocurrencies, so users of the platform now faced a daunting task: how would they even get their money if they couldn’t deposit and withdraw it from their own bank?

As the CEO of Koinex, Rahul Raj stated himself on a blog post on Medium; “The last 14 months have been tough to operate a digital assets trading business in India, on account of the closure of bank accounts holding user deposits.”

To force law-abiding users to have to deal with transactions that their own government is waging a war on is difficult. It meant that Koinex had to find other solutions so that their users could get their money’s worth.

And while there were other payment platforms that worked, Koinex suffered from a constant stream of obstacles like payment denials, closure of bank accounts and disruptions of operations. A very important point to make here is that this also happened for non-crypto transactions such as salary payments, rent, and purchase of equipment.

In other words, just because Koinex was associated with cryptocurrency exchanges, many of their employees got a call from their bank every month, where they were presented with a new problem related to payment and their bank accounts because they worked for Koinex.

Ultimately, there were too many obstacles and too little profit to be made from exchanging cryptocurrency in India. Nobody literally made anything anymore and the Indian Government clearly wanted cryptocurrency out of the way. What simply was left for Koinex to do, was to shut their doors.

Shyp,On-demand shipping startup,Transportation,United States,2013,2018,Shut Down,Multiple Reasons,3,"Jack Smith, Joshua Scott, Kevin Gibbon",Oct-50,3,$62.1M,34,"The world of on-demand startups has been a lucrative one since the founding and subsequent rise of Uber a decade ago. Shyp wanted to do exactly that with an on-demand shipping service in mind. More precisely, Shyp wanted to provide a service that would allow you to take a photo of whatever you want to be shipped, and then upon uploading it on the accompanying mobile app, have a courier pick it up and deliver it to the company headquarters where employees would then box the item using their own high-end custom-packaging and ship it via a FedEx, UPS, or other similar delivery services.

Ad","Started in the summer of 2013, Shyp had everything that San Francisco-based venture capitalists were looking for. For starters, they operated on an app-based business model that was the epitome of recent on-demand service models that were scaling to take the whole world by storm and independent couriers that were personable and incentivized to often arrive before their 20-minute promised time—unsurprisingly a hit with customers. This attracted the likes of Tim Ferris, Naval Ravikant, Slow Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins among many others to participate in the company’s hefty raise of $62 million during their operations. Later on, Shyp also was able to partner with the e-commerce giant Ebay. So what happened that led to their shutdown barely 5 years into existence? 

To begin with, Shyp had vastly overestimated the number of individuals that would regularly ship their items anywhere, let alone pay a flat $5 fee for something simple as a courier picking up and packing your items, regardless of its size. On top of this flaw, they also started charging an extra $3 packaging fee for the marked-up shipping cost. Unlike essential services like cab rides and food delivery that most people would now use at least on a weekly basis, shipping items is a rare and often sporadic activity. To account for this, Shyp started to get small businesses (that ship on a regular basis) into becoming part of their shipping revolution and even started offering volume discounts. This still did not stop the company from shutting down by early 2018. 

In a personal LinkedIn article in 2018, company CEO Kevin Gibbon admits he didn’t listen. “At the time,” he wrote, “I approached everything as an engineer. Rather than change direction, I tasked the team with expanding geographically and dreaming up innovative features and growth tactics to further penetrate the consumer market.” He also said that ""growth, at all costs, is a dangerous trap that many startups fall into, mine included.” In the case of Shyp, the costs that came with packaging materials, renting out physical warehouses and hiring drivers while doing their best to keep prices low to attract customers, made for finer margins and greater demand for using up the startup capital than other ventures."
Anki,Building emotionally intelligent robots,Software & Hardware,United States,2010,2019,Shut Down,Lack of Funds,3,"Boris Sofman, Hanns Tappeiner, Mark Palatucci",100-250,5,$182M,6,"Anki was a robotics and AI startup founded in 2010 that aimed to integrate robotics and IoT (Internet of Things) into children's toys and games. Anki programmed objects so that they could be intelligent and adapt to the physical world, with the aim of solving the problems of positioning, reasoning, and execution in artificial intelligence and robotics. 

Their first successful product was the Anki Drive; which combined a toy racing car and track set with an iOS app for controlling and programming the toy cars. Anki also released other successful products like Anki Overdrive (the successor of Anki Drive) and an interactive toy robot called Cozmo, as well as a more advanced version of Cozmo, called the Vector. The sophistication of Cozmo even made it to Carnegie Mellon University (the founders’ alma mater), where it was used for college-level robotics classes. Cozmo, in fact, came with programing tools ranging from a simple drag-and-drop interface based on MIT’s Scratch Blocks to a full software development kit in the Python programming language.

According to Boris Sofman, the company’s CEO and co-founder, their goal was to create robots that “feel alive.” This included creating naturalistic imperfections in how they moved around, for example. This was in order to make them appear more lifelike to their human companions. Anki’s Cozmo and its successor Vector were 2 products that showed quite a high level of sophistication in what was coined as ""AI emotional intelligence""; which in other words means the capacity to show ""emotion"" to new stimuli.

The company received $50 million in Series A and Series B venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma. In September 2014, Anki announced that it had raised another $55 million in Series C venture funding led by JP Morgan. In June 2016, the company announced its latest round of funding, which amounted to $52.5M, also led by JP Morgan. The total funding to date is $182.5 million.","Anki barely lasted for a decade and completely ceased operations by the end of April 2019. This is not something you would expect from a company that is a brainchild of Carnegie Mellon graduates, and a company that raised close to $200 million in VC funding. The products that Anki produced were also performing really well in the market and at a competitive price tag of under $300, they seemed to do what their competitors in this industry could not. In fact, according to many sources (like Amazon US), Cozmo was the best selling toy of 2017. So what took this promising startup eventually to the grave?

A failed round of financing was reportedly to blame. CEO Boris Sofman told employees that a deal had failed to materialize “at the last minute”, as it also happened with acquisition interests from companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Comcast.

An article published by The Robot Report provides some more information about Anki’s case. According to it, Silicon Valley Bank had a security interest in Anki’s copyrights, patents, and trademarks since March 30, 2018. To receive a loan from SVB, Anki had to put up its intellectual property as collateral. If Anki failed to repay the loan, SVB had the right to seize the collateral to make up for the money it lost in the loan. The report also stated that Fisher & Richardson, a global IP law firm, filed a lien against Anki on June 3, 2019, because it “has not been compensated for patent and trademark prosecution services that it provided for Anki”.

However, can these financial debacles be the sole reason, or is there something inherent within the robotics industry that is to blame? 

A quick look at the failure of other robotics companies within the last year paints a very clear picture. There needs to be a rethink as to the functionality and not just the novelty factor (which tends to fade out very quickly) when thinking of designing the next successful home robot. It is like what Roomba and Alexa have done within the past decade (specialized and functional robots that actually do the job they are meant for).    

A major failure, for example, was Jibo, founded in 2012 by famed MIT roboticist Cynthia Breazeal (a pioneer researcher in human-robot interaction). Jibo went on to successfully raise over $3.5 million when its Indiegogo campaign ended in 2014. They raised a further $73 million in VC funding and Jibo was touted as the first social robot for the home that would actually dance around for you! Another similar failure was the shutdown of Mayfield Robotics. They had released their famed Kuri robot that was touted as being a roaming security camera with a personality. Both robots came with a high price tag and their novelty wore off among users very soon, leading to their shutdowns in late 2018. 

The epic failure of Cozmo and Vector proved the fact even further that despite a successful product line and competitive price tags if products (no matter how well designed) do not prove their value in the consumer market, they will not lead to a sustainable business model for the companies investing in them."
Munchery,Gourmet meals at your doorstep,Food & Beverage,United States,2011,2019,Bankruptcy,Multiple Reasons,3,"Conrad Chu, Tri Tran, Van Tran",100-250,8,$125.4M,20,"Back in 2010, Munchery co-founders Tri Tran and Conrad Chu came up with a seemingly brilliant idea in Munchery. Hiring a team of gourmet chefs that would cook up a variety of uniquely crafted, continually changing menus, Munchery allowed users to order this food and have it delivered straight to their doorstep. Customers would then be able to rate the food and the chefs according to their satisfaction. This idea of gourmet meals on-demand allowed the company to raise its most recent $125 million in total funding and was speculated to be valued at $300 million at its peak.","Munchery had a very interesting growth story. For the first few years, as a San Francisco-based platform for on-demand, microwavable gourmet meals, the business did quite well. Riding on the momentum of early success, in 2015, Munchery, in a bid to outdo its rival Blue Apron, branched into offering ingredients for customers to make their own meals (and providing them the appropriate recipes to do so). The San Fransisco-based startup continued to generate a lot of media buzz and expanded into New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles soon after. They were outperforming Blue Apron and almost every other on-demand food delivery startup, attributed to the convenience their microwavable foods model brought and Munchery’s pride on the quality control they offered that other on-demand startups, who depended upon restaurants, couldn't. They also prided themselves in sourcing 100% natural ingredients and working efficiently under their schedule-ahead model that constantly optimized the efficiency of their couriers.

So what went wrong with this seemingly successful business?

Pascal Rigo, a celebrated chef who at one point served as Munchery’s Chief Customer Experience Officer, stated in his interview with the San Francisco Chronicle that “[startups] can be either a good food company or a good delivery company, but I don’t think anyone has been able to do both.” He left the company in 2015, after just 5 months of joining. Munchery’s attempt to juggle both of these titles led to difficulties at scale.

Munchery also realized late that its original heat-and-serve meals had geographical constraints, as to ensure quality, food had to be delivered within a short drive of its kitchens. To accommodate for this, Munchery accelerated its expansion, setting up expensive production kitchens in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. These proved to be too expensive both financially and logistically, and the new kitchens were shut down by May of 2018. Additionally, new competition from Uber’s Eats spinoff and DoorDash started to kick in and Munchery soon could not match the variety offered by these companies that could source from multiple restaurants.

Another area where Munchery failed was in acquiring new customers. They attempted to use aggressive discounts to achieve success in this sector, offering things like $20 off a user’s first two orders and subscription plans that offered a free 1-month subscription to first-time customers. However, despite these efforts, Munchery failed to retain customers in any significant way. These disappointments led to Tri Tran stepping down from the position of CEO, replaced by James Beriker, who employed a slew of layoffs and other belt-tightening measures. Beriker also raised prices, which would only lead to a further downward spiral for the company amidst increasing competition.

Despite its ambitious mission, Munchery could not deliver on the gourmet experience that it promised and closed its doors to users, alongside similar decisions by startups Spring and Maple—early concepts of the “ghost kitchen” that shut down and was acquired earlier in 2017, respectively.

The company’s online market stage was designed with the goal of productively offering, purchasing, stockpiling and delivering second-hand furniture to its customers. Its focus was to meet the requirement for furniture transfer and urge individuals to reuse furniture while expanding the day and age in which furniture was utilized. Its target was on persons who needed to move houses and sell their furniture or those who desired to revamp their household furniture.","Move Loot officially closed down in July 2016. One of the key issues pointed out was its poor plan of action. They selected to work a substantial furniture stockroom without precisely thinking about the expenses of running it and the assessed benefits. Thus, costs continued soaring while benefits stayed low. The startup also tried to expand and grow to New York and Los Angeles in the expectation of accepting some guaranteed financing. This lopsided cost – income condition prompted mass lay off of its employees.

Move Loot tried to move quickly and attempted to aggressively scale up to its vision a little too fast. Move Loot would bounce starting with one model idea and then dive onto the next one before basically evaluating if the past model even worked. After some rumors of an incoming partnership and acquisitions that never materialized, poor customers review and massive internal layoffs, Move Loot had to officially bring its operations to a stop.

Yogendra Vasupal, the founder, launched the company, under the name Inasra Technologies, in 2005. He then changed the name to Stayzilla in 2010, because the owner wanted to expand his services in all the cities and Zillas (Districts) in India. The company was an early Airbnb business type that provided an online platform in which homestays, ‘alternative stays’, as well as hotels could be listed. Stayzilla had over 15000 stays in about 1100 cities across the country and in 2013 it reached the 500 bookings in a day milestone.","Throughout its 12 years of operation, Stayzilla had to deal with a varied number of challenges.

The potential for a business like Stayzilla was huge, especially because they were among the first companies in India to venture into the sector and make use of technology. However, being the first mover meant also that people were not very familiar with the concept, nor how to take advantage of the service and basically many didn’t even know how to use the internet. So Stayzilla’s first efforts and resources had to be directed towards both educating the market as well as essentially creating homestays.

As more competitors joined the market, various companies tried to differentiate themselves by offering frequent discounts. But Stayzilla’s operations costs were already too high and they were losing money every year. The CEO also mentioned that they had also lost focus on the essential mission they had envisioned for the company.

The company has not been declared officially closed, though, as the CEO considers this a pause to regain clarity and plans to return on the scene with an improved service and a ‘clean slate’ soon."

Preceding each sale, Auctionata gave data to all things to be unloaded on its site. The auctions themselves were held in a TV-studio and streamed on the web. The closeouts were driven by an authorized salesperson and offers were acknowledged by telephone, on the web, by a truant offer, as well as from the studio floor. Auctionata utilized a framework created by its originators, enabling it to transmit the live video stream that provided a real-time working framework without delays. Auctionata was to directly to rival multinational closeout houses, including Christie's and Sotheby's. Since potential bidders never again needed to physically go to the sales, Auctionata's online sell-offs was a revolutionary innovation in the field.","Auctionata's issues originate from its reported unethical behavior, lack of transparency and outright lies by former Auctionata CEO and his close partners.

After months of being in business, reports of management, operational and revenue challenges at the firm arose after an independent auditing company discovered that the auction house was making very few direct deals, members of the company bided on or even bought items on the live sales and the company heavily overstated the amount of profit and sales it made to the public. The organization claimed that the auditing report didn't bring into account private deals and other income streams. The truth of the matter was that none of Auctionata's purported record-breaking online deal accomplishments were ever upheld by real deals. It was additionally noticed that blunders of oversights were a routine at Auctionata which had an embarrassing Yelp! review of 1 star, with customers complaining of everything from delivery times, the alarming disappearance of the items they put on sale on the website (often to be found on eBay) to the complete unresponsiveness of the company representatives. Auctionata, from its part, had the propensity of cleansing all negative data from its records.

The absence of morals, administration mismanagement and the naivety of financial specialists were alarming factors, and so was the willingness of investors to keep funding the startup despite its increasingly dubious reputation and dealings. Auctionata ultimately failed to find new speculators thus filing for bankruptcy and closing down.

Ad","As the network’s CEO put it “the site’s business model wasn’t able to grow its user base big enough and fast enough to survive”.

Middle-aged people might have signed up out of curiosity but the platform probably didn’t have the same traction and influence that sites which aim at a younger demographic have. It’s more likely that it is mainly teenagers and people in their twenties who are more prone be active in online social platforms, inviting friends, sharing content and spending time on it. LinkedIn is an exception here. LinkedIn has a user base of 192 million users who are aged 30 and over, yet the network was successful and gained traction because its central focus was on building business connections. It was later able to transform part of its users to consumers by offering premium plans, acting as a recruiter company and introducing business-oriented courses. TeeBeeDee had nothing of the sort and it was essentially an interesting place to go to when you had some time (i.e. not very much when you are an adult with a family and a work overload), instead of a place that you had to or needed to check every day.

And lastly, within few years of TBD’s launch, a plethora of social networking sites emerged and TeeBeeDee’s site views kept declining. The project failed to gather ulterior funding and it shut down in 2009."

When they first launched they were getting too few customers so they started to offer customization and flexibility which gained them happy and paying customers but became costly for Brisk in the long term but they were reluctant to make customers pay for the additional services (which by the way they didn’t know the existence of) as they knew people expected apps to cost few dollars. So, they tried to push forward until their big break.

With flexibility came a lack of focus, they didn’t know anymore who their customer persona was, and what problem where they exactly trying to solve. Permitting many product cases, although not technically challenging, influenced the company to wind up having an exceptionally unfocused advancement, onboarding, and deals.

The idea of creating a data visualization tool for school and university students did not work. To penetrate in the schools required strong connection to the school administrators, which the company did not have. It was difficult to make money from projects that were meant to be free to the public. There was no demand for viewing graphs which the public had to pay for first. Poliana allowed the public to see the graphs, but to make their own data they had to pay via SaaS model thus incurring expensive charges. Poliana also attempts with local news media were unsuccessful as they had little interest in what the company offered while middle news media were interested but lacked the budget for visualization data technology. International and national media had their own set of experts and data hence the information offered by the company was irrelevant.

There was a fourth profit model that was suggested by many users but which Poliana decided not to pursue. The model involved selling visualization data and information to politicians.

Furthermore, in an attempt to solve the slow delivery rate to their customers, Fab decided to buy their own warehouse in New Jersey. This solution was initially successful as the delivery time went down from 16.5 days to only 5.5 days.  This became the perfect opportunity for Fab to exponentially grow their product inventory. Sales rose up rapidly but what the company didn’t immediately seem to realize was that by scaling up their inventory, they would lose their competitive edge for which they were known for, “providing personal and intimate designs”. The company focused too much of the funds on several initial marketing campaigns which led people into buying an initial product but didn’t help in developing customer purchase patterns they could rely on. The plan on expanding their product inventory backfired as customers realized that they could find the same products for a cheaper price and a faster delivery on Amazon. Customers left Fab in exchange for a better service from Amazon.

In the middle of 2014, CEO Jason Goldberg concluded that it was better to sell the remaining parts of Fab to a prospective company.  In the end, the $1-billion-dollar worth company was sold to PCH Innovations for only $15 million dollars."

Shipitwise,SaaS software for transportation companies,Transportation,Estonia,2016,2019,Acquired,No Market Need,5,"Aleksander Gansen, Anna Medjanskaja, Olari Miiter, Ragmar Saksing & Sander Gansen",10-Jan,5,€419.4K,4,"ShipItWise started out as a way of giving an instant, dynamic quote, or shipping price to anyone, anywhere in the world, using a complex algorithm that their engineers wrote. The idea was that instead of calling and sending emails, thus going back and forth, all you had to do was to use their SaaS solution and you’d get an immediate quote - right there on the spot.

Furthermore, ShipItWise signed contracts with large European freight forwarders and engaged smaller, local businesses to handle the shipping. The idea was that these smaller businesses could outsource their logistics departments to ShipItWise.","There are more than one reason why this startup failed. There are many ways to make money in the world, and one of the best ways to make money is to impose high-profit margins on your customers. 

This is what ShipItWise learned “the hard way” when they pitched their services to the big, global freight companies. A staggering 80% of these companies’ customers are smaller businesses. These smaller businesses are charged with way higher profit margins than the big corporate clients. By offering their solution, a “fair price” to these smaller companies, the companies would instantly see how they had to pay way more than the big corporate clients. 

Naturally, the big freight companies weren’t too keen on doing that. “You’re too customer focused” was the standard answer given to ShipItWise. Nobody wants to lose out on a profitable business model, even it might be entering the borders of ethics and morale. 

Not only that, but the culture in which these freight companies and the overall logistics culture in the world was simply a little too old fashioned. ShipItWise built an API that would digitalize and analyze analog price lists. By doing that, freight companies could easily connect with retailers and e-commerce platforms. 

However, the transportation companies involved weren’t eager on jumping on this new technology and would rather prefer to use the old written form that was manually operated. In addition to that, the transportation companies didn’t see and profits from this technology. They only saw ways in which they could lose money. 

Basically, ShipItWise is the story of a brilliant technological solution that would cut down a lot of costs and money, but where the big companies involved didn’t understand how they would profit from it. 

Several big names in the industry also reached out to ShipItWise and said that they were, to the very least, 2-5 years too early out on the market with their solution. The demand simply wasn’t there yet. 

Maybe during the next decade the demand for an instant, dynamic shipping price will surface. For the time being, it doesn’t look like that.

Its fundamental product was an open source toolbox called the ArsDigita Community System (ACS) that aimed to help support entrepreneurs who had an online business with their group sites by introducing the ArsDigita database. The database would prompt smooth exchanges processing, with consistent work process in every aspect of the E-organizations. The positive development of ArsDigita prompted the formation of the ArsDigita Foundation, that awarded ArsDigita prize yearly to secondary school students. The foundation also supported post-high school students to undertake a one-year software engineering course at an undergraduate level.","Following three years of successful business, ArsDigita began encountering a descending pattern in April 2000. Their decline was ascribed to the procuring of an inexperienced external CEO and the enablement of more power to the financial supporters of the startup. The new group of leaders utilized twofold the speculation beforehand, declined a lucrative offer by Microsoft that could set the organization upon an upward trajectory, and disliked the key organization item, ACS, even though it had repeatedly been used to take care of genuine business issues and made the organization one of a kind and effective.

To exacerbate the situation, they supplanted the ACS with another, mostly closed-source programming bundle that was difficult to utilize, had genuine execution issues and met just a little part of the business needs. Also, they fundamentally expanded the cost of the task by multiplying the number of representatives and making new, generously compensated official positions. The new administration likewise misused the funding. The situation kept on deteriorating until the company finally shut down in April of 2001."
MySpace,Social network based on personal user pages,Social Media,United States,2003,Active,Still Active,Multiple Reasons,7,"Aber Whitcomb, Brad Greenspan, Chris DeWolfe, Colin Digiaro, Josh Berman, Michael Addicott, Tom Anderson",250-500,1,$37.8M,2,"MySpace was originally launched as a side project. Started as a spin-off of Friendster, it grew rapidly to become the most popular social networking site before Facebook entered the scene. It gained 1 million users in about one month after it was officially launched in 2004 and by 2005 it had 20 million registered users. Upon registration on the site, users were given profile pages they could personalize, write posts or blogs, connect with others through comments or messages, share art, stream their own music or that of their favorite artists. The platform principally made profits by serving ads to its users which reached about 76 million in 2008.","MySpace was founded by people in the industry and marketing sector and their perspective of the platform was since the beginning very different from that of Facebook, which nevertheless became its primary competitor. MySpace tried first to ignore Facebook, then to copy it and lastly decided to repurpose itself as a platform for artist and musicians.

There are several reasons why it’s thought that MySpace lost to Facebook. Starting from its poorly organized interface to the often-faulty technology and applications on the site, it was clear that although MySpace had a superb marketing strategy, from the technical side they were way behind other platforms. They later tried to remedy these problems by offering a cleaner design and allowing third-party companies to provide applications for the site.

Since MySpace revenue source was ads serving, it was pressured by investors and partners into taking an aggressive ad publishing strategy, which made their pages even less attractive to users.

In 2010, it’s estimated that 50% of MySpace users simply left and discontinued their use of the site and that continued as the once popular site kept changing ownership and direction every few years.

Besides buggy technology and poor management, the company also faced public image issues when the site started being associated with dubious or even scandalous figures thus alarming parents and earning MySpace negative press coverage. This only accelerated users flock to other platforms such as FB that offered the additional incentive of providing users with news and interactions related to their real-life friends as opposed to anonymous people.

MySpace is currently active and receives an estimated 15 million visitors per month as of 2016 (for comparison, Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users), currently has 53 million songs on the platform and an average of 13 thousand songs uploaded every day on the platform."
